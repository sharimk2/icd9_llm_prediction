Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old man with a
history of alcohol abuse, abdominal pain, and cholecystectomy
complicated by small bowel obstruction and enterocutaneous
fistula and bile leak, discharged from [**Hospital1 190**] the day prior to admission, who presents to
the Emergency Department with bloody emesis.  The patient had
been admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] from
[**10-1**] to [**10-7**] after he presented with diarrhea and
abdominal pain.  He had a presumed migration of the biliary
stent that had been placed in [**Month (only) 404**] following his
cholecystectomy and complications subsequent to that.  At
[**Hospital1 69**] last week, he had an
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**10-5**],
and the biliary stent was removed.  After discharge from the
hospital, the patient states that he began to feel very
fatigued at the shelter where he had been discharged to.  He
had two episodes of diarrhea, the second of which involved
dark stools.  The patient then had a Gastroccult positive
episode of emesis, and was sent to the Emergency Department
here.

In the Emergency Department, he had frank hematemesis, two
episodes total.  One liter of nasogastric lavage revealed
bright red blood with clots, and did not clear.  The patient
was seen by Gastroenterology in the Emergency Department, who
attempted nasogastric lavage again, first obtaining blood,
and then eventually clearing.  The patient was tachycardic in
the 110s to 120s in the Emergency Department, so he was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cholecystectomy in [**2102-12-19**] at [**Hospital 10908**], as well as a biliary stent, complicated by small
bowel obstruction, ELAP, and enterocutaneous fistula and bile
leak
2.  History of alcohol abuse
3.  History of alcoholic ketoacidosis
4.  Asthma
5.  Status post endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography and stent removal on [**2103-10-5**]
6.  History of leg surgery
7.  History of abdominal pain since [**2102-12-19**]

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of alcohol abuse,
requiring multiple admissions to the hospital for
detoxification and ketoacidosis.  The patient lives at a
homeless shelter named [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **].  The patient admits to
smoking about a half pack per day.

MEDICATIONS:  Levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily, Flagyl
500 mg by mouth three times a day, ibuprofen 600 mg every
four to six hours, folate 1 mg once daily, thiamine dose
unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs:  Heart rate
119, blood pressure 135/110, respiratory rate 22, oxygen
saturation 100% on room air.  General:  The patient is
resting in bed, conversant, uncomfortable but in no apparent
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular
movements intact.  Neck:  Flat jugular venous pressure.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic but no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Respiratory:  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds with slight epigastric
tenderness but no rebound or guarding.  Extremities:  No
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ pulses bilaterally.
Neurologic:  Grossly nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC revealed a white blood cell count of
11.2, which was elevated from his last white blood cell count
of 5.6, hematocrit 36.3 which was down from 41.5, platelet
count of 349, MCV 81, normal differential.  Coags revealed a
PT of 14.8, INR 1.5, PTT 25.9.  Chemistries revealed a sodium
of 139, a potassium of 4.5, chloride 101, bicarbonate 23, BUN
26, creatinine 0.9, glucose 166.  Liver function tests
revealed an ALT of 85, AST 59, albumin 3.8, alkaline
phosphatase 127, amylase 61, total bilirubin 0.5, lipase 31.
Toxicology screen was negative.  Electrocardiogram showed no
changes from previous.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 46-year-old man with a
history of alcohol abuse, recent removal of a biliary stent
on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and a
history of chronic abdominal pain since [**Month (only) 404**] when he had
abdominal surgery, who presents with an upper
gastrointestinal bleed.  Differential diagnosis at that time
included varices, peptic ulcer disease and gastropathy,
hematobilia, and duodenal ulcer.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit from the Emergency Department for fluid
resuscitation in preparation for upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy to rule out varices or other causes. He remained
hemodynamically stable while in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, and for this reason he was transferred to Far 7 for
further workup.  He underwent the following procedures as an
inpatient:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which revealed bile
reflux in the duodenum but was otherwise negative.
2.  Right internal jugular line placement as well as a guide
wire change.  This line was eventually removed, and there
were no complications from either procedure.
3.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed new small
bilateral pleural effusions, resolution of bowel wall
thickening which had been diagnosed as terminal ileitis on a
previous admission, and for which he had been receiving
treatment with antibiotics, and no abscess or fluid
collection in the abdomen.
4.  Colonoscopy which revealed diverticulosis but no
inflammation or bleeding.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable as was shown by
serial hematocrit checks throughout the hospital stay.  He
did receive a bag of fresh frozen plasma prior to his
colonoscopy, given that his INR was slightly elevated.
Despite the patient's stable clinical picture, he did
continue to complain of abdominal pain, requiring narcotics
throughout his hospital stay.

Up until the date of dictation, the patient is on the
following medications:
1.  Tylenol #3 one to two tablets by mouth every four hours
as needed for abdominal pain (do not exceed 3 grams per day
of acetaminophen)
2.  Senna two tablets by mouth daily at bedtime
3.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day
4.  Morphine sulfate IR 15 mg by mouth every four to six
hours as needed for breakthrough pain
5.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily
6.  Thiamine 100 mg by mouth once daily
7.  Multivitamins one capsule by mouth once daily
8.  Folic acid 1 mg by mouth once daily
9.  Metronidazole 500 mg by mouth three times a day for a
total of 14 days, to end on [**2111-10-17**]. Levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth every 24 hours for a total
of 14 days, to end on [**10-17**]

Brief Hospital Course:
39 y/o w/etoh abuse and withdrawal seizures found with coffee
ground emesis and intubated at OSH for airway protection s/p
seizure. Transferred first to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], then to medicine for
continued care.

Active issues:
#Altered mental status requiring intubation: Pt was intubated
for airway protection s/p seizure.  Most likely etiology was
alcohol withdrawal given his hx of withdrawal seizures. Pt was
extubated without complication and mental status improved.  Pt
initially on a CIWA scale. Did not receive any benzos for
greater than 48hr prior to discharge.

#Metabolic alkalosis: Most likely [**3-12**] to vomiting. Resolved with
IVF during ICU stay.

#EtOH withdrawal: CIWA and benzos as above

#Leukocytosis: pt with left shift and consolidations on Chest CT
most likely represents aspiration pneumonitis vs aspiration
pneumonia. Started on vanc/CTX/flagyl in ED and changed to
Unasyn/Azithro in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. to complete 5 day course on [**8-22**].

#Elevated CK to 3000: most likely from immobility and
dehydration. Improved with IV fluids.

#?coffee ground emesis: guaiac positive gastric secretions.
[**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear from history of vomiting is most likely.
Other diagnoses include gastritis and PUD. Hct remained stable
during ICU stay. GI was consulted who recommended PPI [**Hospital1 **], daily
Hct, no further bleeding and thus no EGD performed during
admission.

HTN: pt developed persistent HTN during stay with SBP steady in
150s. As pt with oustide PCP and does not know his name, contact
information or location, poor history of follow up, and no
desire to arrange [**Hospital1 18**] PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] not start medication.

[**2188-1-13**] CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECON:
IMPRESSION: The CT angiography shows no evidence of
extravasation from the
arterial structures or evidence of dissection. This is an
arterial phase
study and does not exclude injury to venous structures, but no
obvious
abnormalities in terms of large hematomas are seen adjacent to
the jugular
veins. Subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the neck with a drain
placed in the anterior neck, likely at the site of patient's
trauma.

[**2188-1-13**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
Low lung volumes and slightly more lordotic positioning today
than yesterday may account in part for slight increase in heart
size. Aside from mild left basal atelectasis, lungs are clear,
and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The stomach is
now moderately distended with gas.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room on [**2188-1-12**] into
[**2188-1-13**] for neck exploration.  Esophagoscopy and bronchoscopy
were performed to confirm no injuries to the esophagus or
posterior trachea.  A transection of the cricothyroid membrane
was observed which was repaired.  Penrose drains were left in
the wound to prevent accumulation of fluid and help avoid
abcess.

Post-operatively, she was extubated in the morning, was advanced
in diet and evaluated by psychiatry who recommended inpatient
psych admission after medically/surgically cleared.

She was transferred to the floor.

Floor course:
VS were routinely monitored and she remained hemodynamically
stable. Her respiratory status remained uncompromised and her O2
sats remained WNL on RA. She continued to tolerate a regular
diet, swallowing without difficulty. 1:1 supervision was
maintained at all times. Pyshciatry continued to follow patient.
Pain was managed with PRN narcotic medication. She was started
on a bowel regimen because of the narcotic administraion.  She
remained free from abdominal pain. Ambulation was encouraged and
she ambulated independently.  She received SC heparin for DVT
prophylaxis. Social work was consulted for emotional and family
support.

On POD#5, the surgical drain was removed. The patient remained
without increased swelling or discomfort at the surgical site.
She remained without respiratory compromise or difficulty
swallowing. She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was
discharged to an inpatient psych facility.

Medications on Admission:
none

Discharge Medications:
1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after suffering a stab wound
to the neck.  You were taken to the operating room for repair of
the injury to your neck. You are recovering well from you
injuries and are now being transfered to an inpatient
psychiatric facility for ongoing psychiatric care.

Incision Care:

*Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have
increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision
site.

*Avoid swimming and baths until your follow-up appointment.

*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap
and warm water. Gently pat the area dry.

*Your surgical staples will be removed at your follow up
appointment in clinic.

*You may cover the incision with a dry sterile dressing if it is
draining. If there is no drainage, you can keep it open to air.

You should take the pain medication prescribed as needed to
control your pain. You can also take tylenol in addition to the
oxycodone for pain control, but do not exceed > 4 grams of
tylenol in 24 hours. Your pain should get better day by day.
Pain medication can cause constipation so you should increase
your fluid and fiber intake if possible. It is generally
recommended that you take an over-the-counter stool softener
such as colace to avoid constipation while taking narcotic pain
medications.

   Additional Information:
   Patient / Family Assessment: Received referral through POE for
   EtOH/substance abuse assessment.  Reviewed chart and discussed with
   RN.  Pt is a 34 y.o. divorced, Caucasian man admitted to [**Hospital1 54**] on
   [**2112-11-30**] with dx of pneumomediastinum, rhabdomyolysis, and GI bleed.
   SW met with pt in MICU for EtOH/substance abuse assessment.  Father
   initially present at bedside, though he steps out for SW to interview
   pt individually.  Pt presents as A&O to person and place, naming the
   date as [**2112-1-3**].  Reoriented him.  Discussed his memory of
   what brought him into hospital.  He states he recalls being in the
   bathroom in his apartment trying to fix a flooded toilet.  He states he
   has been told that he passed out and was found naked in the bathroom
   and then brought by ambulance to OSH before being transferred here.  He
   states he had been drinking and describes his pattern as binging on a
   weekly basis.  Pt states he has
always been a heavy drinker,
   describing a history of regular binge drinking with his ex-wife when
   they were married and their friends.  [**Name (NI) **] reports he entered recovery in
   [**2105**] by way of a month-long program in [**Country 2776**] and then stayed sober
   until [**2107**] with the support of regular AA meetings.  He then relapsed
   and, per his report, it seems he has been drinking heavily since,
   although pt does not provide clear details beyond this.  He states he
   and his ex-wife had a daughter in [**2104**] and they then divorced.  Pt
   reports his now 7 y.o. stays with him on the weekends from Fri-Sun and
   that while he never drinks when she is with him, he picks up after she
   leaves and drinks through the week  -
whatever I can get my hands
   on.
  It is unclear when his last drink was.  He states he remembers
   beginning to have seizures a few days ago and going out to buy some
   alcohol to calm him down.  He also speaks of long-standing struggles
   with anxiety and using alcohol as a way to try to manage it.  He states
   he has participated in a number of substance abuse treatment programs
   but is not able to provide details about dates and locations at this
   time.  He wonders if AA was working for him given his tendency to
   relapse so frequently while stating he has enjoyed the meetings and
   forming new connections through AA.  He states he very much liked
   himself when he was sober and wants to be able to maintain sobriety
   again, but he wonders if he is able to do this.  He states,
Sometimes
   I think I should be locked up in solitary confinement
 because it is so
   hard to refrain from drinking.   SW provided motivational counseling
   and began to discuss tx options.  Encouraged pt to think about what
   sort of tx might feel most supportive for him and discussed meeting
   with SW again tomorrow to develop plan.
   With pt
s verbal consent, SW also met with pt
s father in ICU family
   waiting room.  He conveys great concern for pt
s well-being, expressing
   his fear that pt may die if he does not stop drinking very soon.  He
   states he is especially concerned that pt is in the process of being
   evicted from his apartment due to non-payment of rent and he is not
   sure where he will stay.  He states he is not able to take him in as he
   is himself disabled and living with his sister.  [**Name (NI) **] also states pt
   mother (parents are divorced) has been an
enabler
 for pt, often
   giving him money and trying to help him get into treatment, but has
   decided that she is now needing to set limits around this and maintain
   some distance.  Beyond parents, the extent of pt
s support system is
   unclear at this time and warrants further assessment.  Fa also states
   pt has recently lost his job and has no health insurance.  SW contact[**Name (NI) **]
   [**Name (NI) 2580**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Financial Services to request that a MassHealth
   application be completed with pt while he is in the hospital.
   A/P:  Pt presents with long history of EtOH dependence/binge drinking.
     While he has demonstrated a 2 year period of sobriety several years
   ago, he also is at high risk for relapse as he seems to be in the
   process of losing his apartment and job and has just lost his health
   insurance.  His support system is also significantly strained.  He
   expresses a strong wish to maintain sobriety and engage in substance
   abuse tx, and would benefit from as containing a treatment environment
   as possible, i.e. residential.  However, resources are somewhat limited
   due to lack of insurance.
   Clergy Contact: None
   Communication with Team: RN
   Plan / Follow up: SW will plan to meet with pt again tomorrow to
   further explore tx options and develop a dispo plan for when pt is
   medically cleared.  Will maintain contact with pt
s father to update
   him on plan, per his request.  Please page SW with any questions or
   concerns.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Decreased mental status: Thought secondary to etoh
intoxication w/ repeat etoh level greater than 400. Head CT was
neg, no evidence of infection. Tox o/w neg. Extubated on
hospital day 1 and mental status slowly improved during
remainder of hosptial course.

2. Psych: Further history from pt following extubation reveals
h/o bipolar dz on lithium, zypreza and Celexa. Attempted to
arrange psych f/u with [**Hospital1 1474**] VA. Per their records, Patient
has not shown for multiple appointments and thus must go
directly to Building 3 in order to get back into the day
program.

3. EtOH abuse: Empirically started on iv valium q6 during
hospital day 1 and 2. Pt reports h/o etoh withdrawal but no
frank seizures. Following hospital day 2, switched to valium prn
for ciwa greater than 10 - has not required additional valium.
Was seen by social work and has been offered inpt detox vs
shelter with EtOH outpatient services.

4. Hepatitis: Known HCV and also etoh abuse. Mild elevation of
transaminase but u/s without frank cirrhosis no evodence of HCC.
Has been continued on thiamine, folate and protonix. Will need
outpt liver f/u.

5. Pancreatitis: Presumed secondary to etoh and initial
abdominal u/s neg for structural damage. Amylase/lipase improved
during hospital course w/ ivf and pt reporting decreased
abdominal pain and beginning to take po's. Has been advised
against etoh and will require inpt detox as above.

6. Elevated CPK: unclear etiology but neg mb fraction and
troponin. Thought secondary to mild rhabdo/?pancreatitis and has
trended down during hospital course and normalized at time of
discharge.

.
[**6-16**] Abd U/S: Evaluation of the right upper, right lower, left
upper and left lower quadrants of the abdomen demonstrated a
small amount of ascites in the right upper quadrant. The
quantity was not sufficient to mark a spot for paracentesis.
.
[**6-16**] CTA Chest: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. No
consolidation within the lungs.
2. Old compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body.
3. Nodular liver consistent with a cirrhotic liver, associated
small amount of ascites, and likely reactive lymph node at the
gastroesophageal junction.
4. Calcification along the right pectoralis major muscle is
suggestive of a prior hematoma in this region.
.
[**6-16**] CT Head: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Likely old
small infarct in the right cerebellar hemisphere.
.
[**6-16**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. Cirrhosis with small amount of
perihepatic ascites tracking into the right paracolic gutter.
2. Extensive wall thickening of the ascending and transverse
colon indicating colitis of indeterminant etiology, possibly
secondary to liver failure.
3. No evidence of pancreatitis.
.
[**6-17**] Femoral Vascular U/S: Findings most consistent with AV
fistula at the site of the femoral puncture.
.
[**6-17**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. Fatty cirrhotic liver without enhancing
lesions identified. Perihepatic ascites.
2. Bilateral tiny pleural effusions.
.
[**6-20**] CXR: Left basilar opacity since [**2107-6-16**].
.
[**6-22**] CXR: Left lower lobe collapse, unchanged since [**6-20**],
accompanied by increasing moderate left pleural effusion. No
pneumothorax. Tip of the right PIC catheter projects over the
superior cavoatrial junction. No mediastinal widening. The right
lung clear. Mild cardiomegaly stable. Dilated azygos vein
suggests elevated central venous pressure or volume.
.
[**6-23**] RUQ U/S: 1. Nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
2. Moderate amount of ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Abdominal pain: According to past records from [**Hospital1 18**] and from
[**Hospital1 2025**], the patient has a long history of admissions and ED visits
for abdominal pain, as well as a history of narcotic-seeking
behavior.  He has a history of HCV cirrhosis.  The differential
diagnosis of his pain was broad, and included pancreatitis
(although amylase, lipase, and CT findings argue against this),
SBP (paracentesis results were negative), colitis (some chronic
changes noted on CT, no change from prior), and gastritis.  The
patient did have an elevated bilirubin, but RUQ ultrasound was
unrevealing, other than his known cirrhosis.  Chronic mild
elevation of LFTs was felt to be secondary to HCV and EtOH.  The
patient was initially kept NPO and given IV fluids and PPI.  Due
to his somnolence on admission, narcotics were initially
avoided.  Later in the hospital course, the patient was given PO
opiates only, due to his hypercarbic respiratory failure (see
below).  The patient was very demanding and constantly requested
IV pain medications.  He also frequently refused all PO
medications. At time of discharge he was on tramadol po only and
is eating well without significant abdominal pain.  The patient
does claim to have a history of chronic pancreatitis as the
etiology of his pain, so to make a definitive diagnosis he could
be referred for a secretin test.  This can be consider as an
outpatient.
.
# Groin hematoma:  Following placement of a femoral venous
catheter for IV access, the patient developed a hematoma and
became hypotensive.  He was taken to the OR on [**6-18**] given
concern for an AVM.  No AVM was found, but a large hematoma was
evacuated.  A JP [**Month/Year (2) 19843**] was left in place, but on [**6-23**] the patient
pulled this out.  At that time the [**Month/Day (4) 19843**] had still been draining
600-700cc/day.  Serosanguinous fluid continued to [**Month/Day (4) 19843**] from the
site of the JP [**Last Name (LF) 19843**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] vascular surgery recommended placement
of an ostomy bag over the site to collect the fluid and monitor
its volume, as well as to protect the patient's skin.  The
patient's hematocrit remained stable.  Lasix was also restarted
in the hopes that treating the patient's peripheral edema would
help to prevent reaccumulation of fluid in the groin site.
(though albumin is quite low so this may not be successful) The
patient had apparently been on diuretics as an outpatient as
well, but adherence was not certain. Needs follow up with
vascular surgery.
.
#HCV/EtOH Cirrohsis -   Now closer to euvolemic. Continue on
lasix 40 po bid and spironolactone.  Also on lactulose and
rifimaxin with improvement of mental status. Will restart
bactrium SBP prophylaxis.  Paracentesis neg for SBP.
.
#Scrotal cellulitis - Has prior hx of scrotal edema and
bilateral varicoceles per [**Hospital1 2025**] records from [**9-27**].  This admission
was noted to have scrotal erythema and TTP. Started on treated
with levofloxacin and vancomycin when not taking PO. Now will
take a 10d course of cipro.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient was first noted
to be somnolent in the PACU following evacuation of his groin
hematoma on [**6-18**].  ABGs over time were 7.19/69/135 ->
7.23/55/170.  He received 2 doses of narcan with some response,
but the response waned quickly.  He was re-intubated in the PACU
and transferred to the MICU for further management.  He was
extubated on [**6-19**] and transferred back to the floor.  However,
overnight he again became somnolent with a decreased RR and ABG
7.15/63/80.  He had received morphine 2mg IV ~12 hours earlier.
He was again given narcan, after which his RR increased to 24
and he became acutely wheezy and tachycardic to the 140s.  He
was transferred to the MICU, but did not need to be re-intubated
at that time.  No further intervention was needed, and he was
again transferred to the floor.  From that time onward, sedating
medications were kept to a minimum, and IV opiates were avoided
entirely.  As mentioned above, the patient tended to refuse PO
medications, so he received relatively small amounts of
narcotics.  He was noted to have a persistent LLL opacity on
serial CXR, but as he was afebrile and it was not felt that he
had a pneumonia clinicially, he was not treated with
antibiotics.
.
# altered mental status: On admission this was secondary to EtOH
withdrawal/intoxication (see below). There was also concern for
a head bleed given a history of possible head trauma, but head
CT was negative for bleed.  EtOH abuse was treated as below.
The patient remained very agitated, combative, and uncooperative
throughout his admission.  As above, he pulled out a JP [**Month/Year (2) 19843**]
from his groin following hematoma evacuation, and at another
time he pulled out a R IJ central venous line.  He required a
1:1 sitter for his own safety and that of others, as he
threatened to harm staff members and to jump out a window. At
the time of discharge mental status has cleared and he had no
active suicidal ideation.
.
# ETOH abuse: The patient was intoxicated on admission, and he
does have a history of withdrawal and DTs. He was kept on a CIWA
scale with ativan. He was given a banana bag on admission and
was also continued on PO thiamine, folate, MVI. There was no
evidence for acute alcoholic hepatitis on admission.
.
# hypoxia: On admission the patient was found to be hypoxic.  As
mentioned above, it was not felt that he had pneumonia.  Given
that he was also tachycardia, there was also concern for PE.
This was ruled out with CTA of the chest.  He was give albuterol
and atrovent nebs as well, given his history of asthma/COPD  His
hypoxia has now resolved.
.
# leg pain: The patient had this complaint on admissin.  X-rays
were negative for fracture.

   found walking around the room using unstable furniture to aid him. In
   spite of being told that this is an unsafe practice he continues to do
   so. He subsequently starts to bleed from the previous femoral insertion
   site, which was taken out earlier. He was assisted back to bed and
   pressure applied to the area. Patient was again advised that he should
   lie in bed as this was the safest thing for him at this time. However
   he gets out of the bed while it is wet and slippery, security was
   called as patient was posing a danger to himself and being very

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course to date:  Pt is a 55 yo male with metastatic and
obstructive pancreatic cancer that was initially admitted on
[**2148-7-23**] for abdominal pain, bacteremia and biliary tube
replacement.
- Biliary drainage and bleeding: Pt was initially evaluated in
the ED and interventional radiology was called for replacement
of the tube which was done.  However, the patient was found to
have significant bleeding around the drain site (after dry
heaves) and was taken the following morning to the IR suite for
replacement of the biliary drain on [**7-25**] for a larger drain.
After initial bleeding, pt required 1 U transfusion.  Pt
continued to have bleeding into biliary drain tube, and was
transfused 2 units on [**7-27**] due to low hct.  Then on [**7-28**] patient
had episode of hematemesis with AM Hct was found to be 24.  On
[**7-29**] patient had an angiogram that did not show any bleeding
location and cholangiogram.  Hct after angiogram was 21.  Pt was
then transfused 2 units.  The following day, the patient had an
EGD that did not show any sign of bleeding.  however, the night
of [**7-30**], pt was found to have excessive bleeding in biliary
drain with hypotension and was transferred to the ICU.
- [**Name (NI) 11646**] Pt was initially found to have [**1-20**] blood cultures
positive for pan sensitive Ecoli.  This was treated with
Levofloxacin per ID recommendations.  Flagyl was added for
elevated WBC.
- While in the ICU, the patient was transfused until he had a
stable hct. He required multiple transfusions as he had several
episodes of hematobilia.  While in ICU, pt had an IVC filter was
placed as well as a PICC.  CT was done that showed metastatic
lesions in spleen, liver and lymphadenopathy.  Pt was placed on
PCA for pain management
-After discharge from the ICU the patient continued to have low
hct and the family and patient would like the patient to be
discharged home with hospice.  The patient was weaned off PCA
and sent home with hospice care with appropirate pain
medications including dilaudid SL and a fentanyl patches.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


CT Abd/Pelvis [**2172-2-11**]
CT ABDOMEN: There are trace bilateral pleural effusions. Absence
of
intravenous contrast limits evaluation of the abdominal
parenchymal organs and vasculature. There is CT evidence of
anemia. Liver is nodular in contour, and slightly shrunken,
consistent with reported history of cirrhosis. There is an
ill-defined hypodensity in segment IV (2, 19), which is
incompletely characterized without IV contrast.
There is pneumobilia, as well as air within the gallbladder
lumen. Gallbladder is also filled partially with oral contrast,
which appears to have entered the gallbladder via a fistulous
connection from the second portion of the duodenum. In this
region, the duodenum is markedly thickened, with prominent
peri-duodenal inflammatory stranding. Air and oral contrast
material is also seen in the distal common bile duct. There is
soft tissue prominence in the region of the ampulla, though no
definite nodule or mass is seen, and this prominence may be
post-procedural related to recent EUS.
There are prominent porta hepatis, and peripancreatic lymph
nodes, but the
non-contrast appearance of the pancreas itself is unremarkable.
Pancreatic
duct is not dilated. There are no pancreatic calcifications.
Prominent
varices are seen throughout the left upper abdomen. Spleen is
mildly
enlarged. Non-contrast appearance of the kidneys is
unremarkable. Adrenal
glands are normal in size bilaterally. There is no free
intraperitoneal air.
CT PELVIS: Pelvic loops of large and small bowel are
unremarkable.
Genitourinary structures are unremarkable. Urinary bladder is
decompressed
with a Foley catheter balloon in place. There is no free pelvic
fluid or
abnormal pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
There is no osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy. Mild
lumbar spine
degenerative changes are noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Pneumobilia, and air and oral contrast material within the
gallbladder
lumen, concerning for fistulous connection between the adjacent
ulcerated
second portion of the duodenum seen on recent EGD.
2. Cirrhotic liver, with incompletely characterized hypodensity
in segment
IV, prominent periportal lymph nodes, and numerous large
splenorenal varices in the left upper quadrant.
3. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 55 year-old male with a history of ETOH/ Hep C
cirrhosis,  [**Year/Month/Day 7344**] abuse who presented from OSH with
coffee ground emesis, and found to have duodenal ulcers and
pneumobilia. Upper endoscopy at OSH revealed two duodenal
ulcers, one which had appeared to be perforated or fistulized.
Hepatology was consulted and recommended pantoprazole IV drip
and octreotide. The octreotide was discontinued after one day.
He was given dilaudid for pain. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole
were started. Surgery was consulted and recommended repeat
abdominal CT.  CT revealed pneumobilia, with air and oral
contrast in gallbladder and CBD, which was thought to be most
commmon with fistulous connection between the duodenal ulcer and
gallbladder.  He was transferred to the surical service on his
third hospital day.

On [**2-10**], he was given vitamin K 10mg IV X1 on [**2-12**], in
preparation for surgery, given his INR was 1.9. He underwent
cholecystectomy with closure of cholecystoduodenal fistula for
duodenal ulcer with cholecystoduodenal fistula. Surgeon was Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]. Please see operative note for complete details.
Operative findings included cirrhotic liver with some ascites
and the gallbladder was
quite inflamed as was the entire porta. Per the OP note,
""dissection was quite difficult and bloody given the patient's
inflammation and cirrhosis. We were able to get around the
fistula and the fistula was transected revealing a hole in the
duodenum of approximately 1 cm."" 4 silk sutures were used to
close the duodenal
hole. Details of the sutures were then used to fix the omentum
down over this as a patch. An NG and JP drain were placed.

Postop, he was sent to the SICU for management. JP drainage was
sanguinous.He was transfused with blood products to keep
hemodynamics stable. Hematocrits stabilized. LFTS increased
though, but later trended down.  Daily [**Hospital1 **] Lactulose enemas were
started on pod 1 as he was NPO and on bowel rest. TPN was
started. IV methadone (10mg  q 12 hours) was started to assist
with pain control as well as iv dilaudid and ativan prn for
agitation given h/o substance abuse. Last EtOH use was approx 1
yr ago. Heroin use IV earlier this month. He did not have
signs/symptoms of withdrawl on admission though he was given
ativan for anxiety.  He was given multivitamins, thiamine, and
folic acid. He became increasingly confused/disoriented with O2
desats with PCA use. PCA was held and dose decreased with
improvement.

On [**2-14**], he was transferred to the med-[**Doctor First Name **] unit where NPO
status and NG continued. NG was removed on [**2-18**]. Sips were
started on [**2-20**]. The volume of JP drainage decreased to ~
110cc/day and became more consistent with ascites fluid. He
continued to have waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] delerium. Lactulose enemas [**Hospital1 **]
continued and Rifaximin was started on [**2-19**]. Methadone wean was
started and weaned off by [**2-21**]. Ativan and dilaudid doses were
decreased with ativan later discontinued but restarted due to
anxiety issues. He continued to have a 1:1 sitter to prevent
removal of the NG/IV until [**2-21**]. LFTS trended down and cbc/lytes
remained stable on TPN. He became much more clear and the sitter
was able to be stopped

The JP drainage decreased and the drain was removed on [**2-24**] as
output was 110cc of straw colored fluid for the previous 24
hours. Prolene stitch placed to LRQ due to excessive drainage
through dressings. Stitch to be removed as an outpatient.

A picc line was inserted in the left arm. This site became
swollen and an US was done to evaluate for DVT. This US revealed
a thrombosed left basilic vein with PICC line in place. No
thrombus in the deep veins of the left arm or in the central
veins were noted. TPN continued thru [**2-21**] then was d/c'd on [**2-21**]
as well as the Picc line as he tolerated diet advancement.

PT was consulted and recommended using a cane for safety. He was
cleared for discharge with outpatient continued PT to work on
safety, strength and balance. He is ambulating independently
with the cane, but required reminders to use the cane as he
would forget to use.

Antibiotics were stopped on [**2-24**] (flagyl, ampicillin and cipro).
He remained afebrile.

The patient has a history of seizure disorder, but not history
of seizures while withdrawing in past.  He was managed on oral
neurontin at home. Neurontin was switched to IV keppra and then
to PO which is his discharge medication. No seizures were noted
during this hospital stay.

Lasix, spironolactone and inderal were restarted at the end of
the hospitalization for cirrhosis management.

Service:  TRAUMA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50-year-old male
pedestrian, struck by a car going approximately 35 miles an
hour, with loss of consciousness, obvious deformity of the
right lower extremity which was splinted.  On transport, his
systolic blood pressure was reported to be in the 80s.  On
presentation, he was awake and following commands, GCS of 12.
The patient was intubated in the field.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: None.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  History of alcohol abuse.  The patient is
homeless.

EXAMINATION:  VITALS:  98.1??????, 130, 80/palp, which increased
to 160/130 and then returned to 80/palp, satting 100%,
intubated.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal, round, reactive to
light bilaterally.  TMs were clear bilaterally.  HEART:
Regular.  LUNGS:  Clear.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, but 15 minutes later became distended.  Rectal
tone was normal with guaiac negative.  Pelvis was stable.
EXTREMITIES:  In the right lower extremity there is an
obvious tib-fib fracture with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial pulses, otherwise no deformities.  BACK:  There were
abrasions over the lumbar spine but no step-off.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  White count 5.1, hematocrit 42.8,
platelets 76, PT 12.1, PTT 29.3, INR 1, fibrinogen 262,
sodium 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 114, bicarb 22, BUN 7,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 199, lactate was 6.  UA showed 750
red blood cells.  Tox screen:  alcohol 192, positive for
opiates and benzo.  ABGs:  7.44, 36.2, 25.  Chest x-ray was
negative.  Pelvic exam shows a right inferior and superior
pubic rami fracture.  Patient's back exam was negative.

The patient had a left subclavian Cordis placed in the trauma
bay.  The patient's pelvis was wrapped tightly and the
patient had a grossly positive CPL.  The patient went to the
O.R. for exploratory laparotomy.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient went to the O.R. for exploratory
laparotomy, was found to have a ruptured spleen with
splenectomy performed.  Then the patient was admitted to the
Trauma ICU.  Post-op, the patient had a head CT which showed
a left maxillary sinus fracture with no intracranial
hemorrhage.  A CT of the C-spine showed no fracture.  A CT of
the abdomen showed right inferior-superior pubic rami
fracture, normal kidneys.  A CT cystogram showed no
extravasation of the contrast.

In Trauma ICU, ortho was consulted for the right tib-fib
fracture and also for increased compartment pressure in the
right lower extremity. Decision was made to take the patient
to the operating room on [**2161-9-30**] in the morning for
fasciotomy and external fixation of the right tib-fib
fracture.  On the following day, the patient returned to the
O.R. for ORIF of the right lower extremity.  The patient
remained in the Trauma ICU for three days and was weaned off
of pressors and drips.

Oral maxillofacial surgery was consulted for the left
maxillary sinus fracture seen on facial CT, and the decision
was made that the findings were consistent with an old
fracture with no intervention needed at this time.

Urology was consulted for hematuria with a hematoma at the
base of the penis.  There was no extravasation of contrast on
cystogram.  The patient was to go for a retrograde
urethrogram, however patient was not cooperative.  The
patient self DC'd his Foley and was urinating without
difficulty.

Plastic Surgery was consulted for closure of a defect on the
right tibia.  A vac was placed and a split thickness skin
graft was performed to the right lower extremity on
[**2161-10-7**].  The patient was also found to have a fracture of
the left second metacarpal, which was also repaired by
Plastic Surgery on [**2161-10-7**].

For nutrition, the patient was started on TPN in ICU and
changed to tube feeds, then tolerating p.o. with adequate
calorie counts.

The patient was given prophylactic immunizations while in
hospital:  Pneumovax, HIB, meningococcal vaccination.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is DC'd to rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pedestrian struck by motor vehicle with a splenectomy,
right tib-fib fractures with external fixation, with
fasciotomy; then open reduction, internal fixation followed
by split thickness skin graft on the right lower extremity.
2.  Right inferior-superior pubic rami fracture.
3.  Left maxillary fracture, which is old.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. to be given his last dose on

The patient will also need a repeat HIB, Pneumovax and
meningococcal vaccination to be given in 6 to 12 weeks.

The patient is nonweightbearing until seen by Plastic
Surgery.  He is to keep his left upper extremity elevated.
Once weightbearing status is cleared by Plastic Surgery, the
goal is for 50% partial weightbearing on the right lower
extremity.  The patient is to followup with Trauma Clinic

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo M with history of asthma and EtOH abuse presented with
asthma flare.  On presentation he had a respiratory acidosis
likely [**2-10**] CO2 retention from EtOH intoxication and acute asthma
flare, with possible component of COPD as well given patient's
50 pack-year smoking hx.   In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he recieved one day of
solumedrol and then was transitioned to PO prednisone 60 with 2
week outpatient taper.  He was also given neb treatments q4h.
His peak flows were followed and remained in the low 200s (his
baseline was unknown; predicted was 580 cc).  Prophyllactically,
he received pneumovax [**2173-10-11**].  He was ordered a steroid
inhaler and prn albuterol inhaler for his discharge but eloped
from the hospital without them.
.
He had a history of EtOH abuse for over 40 yrs, having been to
rehab several times in past and cared for previously at [**Hospital1 2177**].
His LFTs were normal.  He was in acute withdrawal when he
presented to the floor and received valium 10 mg Q4 prn CIWA
scale score >10.  He recieved MVI, thiamine, B12, folate daily.
A SW consult wwas placed to arrange outpatient alcohol
rehabilitation, possible at the McInness house.  To facilitate
placement, a PPD was placed on [**2173-10-13**] and was negative (0 mm
induration).
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was hypertensive and had an EKG with
possibile inferolateral ischemia.  His progressive DOE may be
manifestation of coronary disease or CHF rather than lung
disease.  Cardiac Enzymes were negative.  He was started on ASA
325 po qd.  His BB was held in house given acute asthma flare,
but he was written for a BB as an outpatient.  On the floor his
blood pressure was controlled with captopril Q8.

His free water deficit was calculated to be 2.5 L from EtOH
consumption.  This was repleted and he received a banana bag on
[**10-11**].  He tolerated [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **]/Cardiac diet while in house.  He was
placed on a PPI.

SW and Case managers worked dilligently on his discharge plan
for McInness house (medical stabilization for homeless),
[**Hospital1 **] stabilization center (for EtOH sobriety), or [**Location (un) **]
Shelter (homeless shelter with health facility).  They arranged
for him to get [**Location (un) 1131**] glasses and prescription medications for
the weekend.  On morning of discharge the patient left AWOL.  No
review of discharge plans or discharge medications or
disposition or follow-up arrangements could be made as a result.


Should the patient return for care at [**Hospital1 18**], he would benefit
from PFTs, Stress test, and development of a relationship with a
PCP.

Chief Complaint:
Vague diffuse abdominal discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
55 yo M with h/o chronic EtOH abuse, HTN, ?DM2, and asthma,
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**1-8**]->[**2123-1-9**] with intoxication and
right rib fracture, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED after presenting
to clinic intoxicated.  He was initially combative and agitated,
but improved.  He complained of chest pain and was found to have
a troponin of 0.02.  On last admission, he was ruled out for MI
with negative cardiac enzymes.
.
In the ED he received 10 IV valium x 2, 40 meq K, banana bag,
and Mag.  He fell out of bed and a head CT was obtained.  He had
an episode of vomiting and became hypoxic, requiring a NRB mask,
and was sent for CXR.
.
He now complains of diffuse abdominal pain.  He is unable to
provide much history, due to recently receiving valium.  He
denies SOB, chest pain, N/V/D, headache, constipation, blood in
BMs, palpitations or anxiety.
.
ROS: Per patient and OMR records, he was hit by a car in early
[**Month (only) 1096**] with consequent rib fracture.

Past Medical History:

RESP: Diffuse expiratory wheezes. Distant BS.  No crackles.
CVS: RRR.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmur or rub.
GI: + BS.  Diffuse abdominal tenderness.  Voluntary guarding on
deep palpation.  No rebound.  No mass palpable.
EXT: Some superficial skin wounds.  No edema.  warm.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: In the frontal view, a sliver of lucency projects above the
splenic flexure without a clear corresponding abnormality on the
lateral.  If symptoms persist, I would recommend radiographic
evaluation of the left hemidiaphragm in the right decubitus
position to exclude small volume of pneumoperitoneum.  The
region of the right hemidiaphragm is normal.  Mild cardiomegaly
is unchanged and mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality is
stable since at least [**1-7**] and probably more chronic.
.
CT Abd: 1.  Acute left posterior rib fracture - eleventh rib
associated with small focal muscle hematoma with no associated
visible injury to the left kidney or spleen.  There is
associated atelectasis at the left lung base and this should be
followed up with imaging to assure clearance.
2.  Atherosclerosis including visceral branches and dense plaque
at the origin of left renal artery end coronary atherosclerosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 55 yo M with history of EtOH abuse, asthma, and HTN
who presented with diffuse abdominal pain and was undergoing
EtOH detoxication.  The patient was placed on valium per CIWA
scale for acute alcohol withdrawal.  Since he presented s/p
fall, a head CT was done that was negative for bleed.  He was
quite somnolent, diaphoretic, and agitated on his day of
admission and was transferred to the ICU overnight for
monitoring.  He was transferred back to the floor the next day.
He continued to become agitated but required less valium.  The
patient expressed no interest in stopping EtOH consumption.  SW
was consulted but was not able to see the patient before he left
AMA.  He did receive a banana bag in the ED, and thiamine,
folate, and MVI daily.  He was monitored for aspiration and
fall.
.
The patient's abdominal pain was vague and chronic; it was
thought likely to be EtOH pancreatitis vs hepatitis or referred
pain from his broken rib.  CXR showed no pneumonia.  He was
tolerated a regular diet on discharge and his LFTs were stable.
Ibuprofen was administered for rib pain.
.
The patient was slightly hypoxic on admission.  This was thought
to be due to aspiration pneumonitis vs PNA from vomiting in the
ED.  The patient was given albuterol and atrovent nebs.  He
remained afebrile and his oxygenation improved on its own.
.
The patient was also noted to have a pruritic erythematous rash
to trunk and neck.  This was concerning for allergic reaction or
contact dermatitis.  It responded to one dose of benadryl.
.
He was ruled out for MI with serial cardiac enzymes.  Initial
EKG showed ST depressions in inferior leads that resolved on
subsequent EKGs.  He was started on aspirin in house.
.
The patient left the hospital AMA abruptly, before he could be
seen or evaluated by the attending medical physician

Brief Hospital Course:
61M w/ hx alchol abuse and HCV who was found unresponsive by EMS
on the street who was then intubated given low respirations for
inability to protect his airway and found to have polysubstance
intoxication with ethanol and benzos. By morning after
admission, pt had awoken, was extubated without event, and
insisted on leaving the hospital; was ambulating without
difficulty and speaking coherently. He left the ICU before
further w/u or care could be provided.
.
# Airway protection - Pt was found down and unresponsive. He was
subsequently intubated due to minimal respirations at 2x/min for
airway protection given his intoxication as evidenced by his
highly positive ethanol level. His vent settings were weaned
quickly o/n, and he was extubated without event by the morning
after admission.
.
# Unresponsiveness - Most likely due to polysubstance abuse with
ethanol and benzodiazepines. He has had multiple presentations
in the ED for alcohol abuse and was seen in the ED on the day
prior to this admission, because he was found altered v.
intoxicated.  A CT scan of his head and neck was done at that
time because he had a laceration above his left eyebrow, that
was repaired with glue and were negative for bleed or fracture.
Pt had no stigmata of active infection. CT head and C-spine were
unremarkable; he was maintained on CIWA w/ ativan, and was given
a Banana bag x1 L, MVI, thiamine, and folate. Pt left the
hospital before consult social work and the addiction team could
be consulted.
.
# Anion-gap acidosis - Most likely due to elevated ethanol and
lactate levels.
.
# Hypernatremia - Pt w/ mild hypernatremia of 147 that was
likely due to lack of free water as it is unclear what his diet
may truly be like.
.
# Hx mild transaminitis - Likely due to combination of chronic
alcohol abuse and HCV.
.
# Hx Hypertension - initially held home Amlodipine (unclear if
was really taking this at home) given SBP in the low 100s upon
admission.
.
TRANSITIONS OF CARE:
-Pt left before f/u could be established. Pt likely needs
assistance in cessation of alcohol and related social issues, as
he has had recurrent admissions for intoxication or being found
down.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the vascular surgical service. After informed
consent was obtained and carefully informing her of all the
potential risks of the procedure, she still decided to proceed
with the operation. Accordingly, she was taken emergently to the
operating room with the cardiac surgical team. She underwent a
1) Repair of contained rupture of thoracoabdominal aneurysm with
30-mm Gelweave graft.  Cold circulatory arrest. Atrial femoral
bypass 2) Graft from distal to the left subclavian artery at the
proximal anastomosis, distal anastomosis beveled include all the
visceral vessels on [**2141-2-26**].  Intraoperative fluids included 6L
crystalloid, 3700ml of pRBC, 2300 ml of FFP, 600ml platelets,
670ml cryoprecipitate. The chest was closed and abdomen was
packed opened due to her critical state. Please refer to
operative note for more details.

Postoperatively, she was transferred to the CVICU for
monitoring. She needed aggressive resuscitation. Chest tube
output was with 1L of sanguinous drainage after 1.5 hours. She
develped extensive subcutaneous emphysema to her chest
bilaterally. There was trouble attempting to ventilate the
patient. Chest X-ray showing completely opacified left lung.
Despite chest tube with high output, it was still clotted off
and required frequent stripping. The decision was to place
another tube to decompress the chest, subcutaneous air and
facilitate drainage. While attempting to place the chest tube,
massive clot exsanguinated from the chest. There was copious
amounts and profuse drainage. Patient's pressure began to drop
and she was coded for approximately 3 minutes. Level I
transfusion protocol was initiated. Pt's was still critically
unstable and hypotensive. The decision by all members of staff -
vascular surgery, cardiac surgery and ICU team was to withdraw
measures given already high morbidity.

She was pronounced dead at 218pm.

Medical examiner declined autopsy.

sister, said he wanted to come to [**Hospital1 **] for psych help. Patient
admits to drinking today, claims no other drugs. Found
hypotensive SBP to 50s, somnelent.
.
Of note, patient eloped from [**Hospital1 **] yesterday [**2170-7-31**] @ 11:30am. He
had been admitted for acute alcohol intoxication and withdrawal
following trauma and assault. CT head and C spine were negative
for fracture or bleed. He was quite agitated in the ED,
requiring chemical sedation and transfer to the MICU. Treated
with valium for withdrawal. Though he endorsed suicidality on
presentation, this resolved with resolution of his intoxication.
He remained mildly sedated due to medications. Social work was
consulted. Though he was clinically improving, patient did not
complete his medical treatment. He was to be followed by PCP as
outpatient, who dispenses his Methadone.
.
Today, at triage noted to have BP in 50's, initially awake and
talking. By the time pt arrived in room, he was somnolent,
minimally responsive to sternal rub, pinpoint pupils. He smelled
of ETOH. Intial full vitals were 91 61/38 14 92% RA. He denied
ingestion of pills or other substances than alcohol. He was
given 1mg narcan and aroused with improvement of blood pressure
without any IVF. It was decided to start a narcan drip but
before a drip arrived from pharmacy, he was noted to maintain
pupils 3-4mm, good ventilation and good urine output so narcan
drip was deferred. FSG 83.  Tox screen was sig for ETOH 260
He also received thiamine 100mg IV. EKG showed SR 89, NA/NI,
poor baseline.;
Toxicology was consulted for hypotension and altered mental
status with hx of alcoholism and opiate abuse/dependence. In

tachycardic in the 110s-130s.
.
In the ED, he desaturated to the 80s on room air and 90-91% on
NRB, and chest film demonstrated a questionable LLL opacity vs.
atelectasis.  Repeat chest film done 3h later then demonstrated
a patchy RLL opacity.  For this reason, he was started
empirically on levaquin and flagyl.
.
In the ED he complained of tremors and scored consistently over
30 by CIWA scale.  In total, he received 2L of NS, 1L of D5 [**1-28**]

Brief Hospital Course:
40M with h/o EtOH abuse and withdrawal now admitted with
EtOH/benzodiazepine intoxication and signs of EtOH withdrawal.
.
1. EtOH withdrawal: The timing of the patient's last drink was
uncertain, but he had signs and symptoms of withdrawal, incuding
tachycardia, agitation, and tremors.  In the ED he was given
fluids, thiamine, folate, MVI, valium, and ativan.  On transfer
to the ICU, IV hydration was continued, as well as folate,
thiamine, and MVI.  He was kept on a CIWA scale with valium.
Social work was consulted for substance abuse, as well as for
help with resources, but the patient was not able to talk with
SW initally because of his withdrawal symptoms.  On [**2126-1-4**] the
patient asked to leave the hospital AMA because he did not feel
that the valium was working for him, and when this was not
immediately allowed he tried to leave the hospital.  A code
purple was called, with security and psychiatry arriving to the
patient's room to assess his capacity given that he was still in
withdrawal and receiving frequent valium doses.  He was found to
have capacity, so he did sign out AMA.  He refused help in
finding a homeless shelter.
.
2. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's chest xray in the ED
was initially read as possible pneumonia, so he was started on
levofloxacin and flagyl.  However, the patient did not have a
fever, elevated WBC count, or other evidence of infection, so
this was considered to be more likely an aspiration pneumonitis
and antibiotics were discontinued.  Repeat chest xray showed
resolution of the opacity.
.
3. FEN: The patient was given IV hydration while not taking PO.
His diet was then advanced as tolerated.  Electrolytes were
monitored and aggressively repleted.  Thiamine, folate, and MVI
were given.
.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient was on SC heparin for DVT
prophylaxis.

trauma. Yesterday the patient had a chest x-ray that showed
pneumonia; upon sobering he stated that he has been coughing and
was told to back to the ED for treatment of his pneumonia.

In the ED, initial VS were T 98, HR 88, BP 95/48, RR 14, SpO2
88% RA. On arrival, the patient was intoxicated and observed
overnight until sobriety. Portable CXR showed RLL infiltrate
that appeared improved from prior CXR on [**7-4**]. Labs were notable
for a serum EtOH level 265, positive serum benzos, Na 149,
lactate 1.8, and elevated bicarb 35. This morning, the patient
was found to be hypoxic to 87-88% on 6L NC. He was placed on a
NRB for about 20 min; O2 sat improved, then he was switched back
to nasal cannula with O2 sat 94-95% on 6L NC. He received
levofloxacin and will receive flagyl. The ED team was concerned
that the pneumonia seen on CXR did not fully account for the
degree of hypoxia, and ordered a CTA to rule out PE, however,
patient became upset and refused CTA so it was not performed.
The complained of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and received
ativan 0.5mg IV.

Of note, the patient has been hospitalized at least four times
over the past month, leaving AMA and eloping on most of his
hospitalizations. Most recently he eloped from the ED 2 days ago
([**7-8**]) after being searched by [**Hospital1 18**] police and before being
seen by an ED attending. In the past, he has threatened nursing
staff ""I will come back and shoot you"" and ""I want you dead."" He
has used profanities toward staff, has been uncooperative
requiring security involvement, leather restraints and
pharmacologic interventions.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient is lethargic and somewhat
somnolent, but becomes irritated when he is asked questions. He
is cursing at staff, but answering questions. During the
interview, when notified that he would not be receiving
methadone, he pulled out his IV and threatened to leave AMA.
Upon standing and putting on his clothes, he reported that he
felt too weak to leave, and decided to stay.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Pneumonia: Patient had been admitted recently for hypoxia and
pneumonia and had left on [**7-5**] after receiving only 2 days of
treatment with levofloxacin and flagyl. However, sputum culture
from that admission grew coagulase + staph resistant to
levofloxacin. CXR performed on admission did show improvement of
the RLL infiltrate previously see on [**7-4**]. In the ED, the patient
received a dose of levofloxacin and flagyl. After arriving to
the MICU, the patient complained of being subjectively short of
breath, although physical signs were unconcerning. Patient was
started on bactrim ds 1 tab po q12hr based on sensitivity
patterns from the sputum culture. Patient left AMA on hospital
and antibiotic day 2.

# COPD: Given shortness of breath as well as history of greenish
sputum production, consideration was paid to potential
contribution of COPD exacerbation. Patient was offered
ipatropium and albuterol nebs, which he refused. Patient left
AMA as above.

# Alcoholism: Patient was actively abusing alcohol and presented
to the ED intoxicated. During our interview, he threatened to
leave AMA to go drink. He also refused to speak with social
worker. Ciwa scale was initiated q2hr with diazepam. Patient
required 60 mg diazepam over the course of the first 24 hrs.
Patient then left AMA>

# Chronic pain: Patient reported a history of chronic pain in
the context of multiple MVAs and surgeries. He claimed to be on
methadone, but during his last admission [**Date range (1) 45401**], his PCP was
[**Name (NI) 653**] and states that he has not prescribed the patient
methadone in 1 month because of aberrant behavior and repeatedly
negative urine tox screens. When told that he would not be
receiving methadone, the patient decided to leave AMA, but then
changed his mind because he said he felt too weak. Subsequently,
he left AMA.

# Tobacco abuse: Smoking cessation counseling and nicotine patch
were offered. Patient refused. Patient subsequently left AMA.

Family History:
unknown

Physical Exam:
VS - 77, 124/98, 95% RA, 12, 96.5
HEENT - anicteric sclerae, OP clear, MMM
LUNGS - CTA
HEART - RRR, S1, S2
ABD - soft, NT, ND, neg Murphys, liver 3-4 cm within costal
margin
EXT - high frequency resting tremor; no asterixis
NEURO - alert and oriented; tangential.

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT: There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right
greater than left. There are associated atelectatic changes at
both lung bases. A few small blebs are seen at the right lung
apex, and there is linear scarring at the left lung apex. There
is no focal consolidation. Secretions are seen within the upper
trachea. Bronchi are, however, patent to the segmental level. A
few small nonpathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are
present.
A left subclavian central venous catheter is present with its
tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. Images of the upper
abdomen demonstrate markedly distended stomach with air,
debris/foodstuff, and high-density presumably oral contrast
material within it.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar effusions and associated atelectasis.
2. Distended stomach as described above.

Abd u/s:
1) Diffusely echogenic and coarsened hepatic parenchyma, likely
consistent with fatty infiltration, though more severe forms of
liver disease such as cirrhosis/fibrosis are not excluded.
Probable area of focal fatty sparing anterior to the hepatic
artery in the right lobe.
2) Unremarkable Doppler evaluation of the hepatic vasculature.
3) Small right pleural effusion.
4) Trace amount of free fluid within Morison's pouch.
5) Contracted gallbladder, not well evaluated on this study.

Head CT:  There is a small area of left frontal lobe
encephalomalacia, indicating previous infarction.  There is no
acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
structures, mass effect or hydrocephalus.  No major vascular
territorial infarct is identified.  The ventricles and sulci are
prominent consistent with age-related involutional change.
Unchanged focal areas of decreased attenuation within the
periventricular and subcortical white matter likely represent
microvascular infarctions.  Linear foci of increased density
over the bilateral frontal lobes may represent partial volume
averaging effect.  The visualized osseous structures, mastoid
air cells and paranasal sinuses are grossly unremarkable.
.
CXR: PA film, rotated.  Clear lung fields, distinct
hemi-diaphragms, clear heart borders.

1. Extremely low lung volumes on this limited study, but no
definite evidence
of pneumothorax or hydrothorax. PA and lateral films should be
obtained when
the patient is able.

2. Extremely distended gaseous stomach.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was immediately transferred to the operating room for
exploratory laparotomy, which showed violation of the peritoneum
but no intraabdominal solid/hollow organ injury.
Postoperatively, she was placed on an epidural
dilaudid/lidocaine infusion for pain control, and transferred to
the floor. On POD#0, whe began to become tachycardic to the
130s-150s, febrile, and had difficulty maintaining adequate
saturation. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Pan culture was
negative for acute infection. A work up for pulmonary embolus
was negative, and no acute infiltrates were identified. She was
transferred to the trauma/surgical ICU for closer monitoring.
Over the next 2 days, she defervesced, and her saturations
improved with discontinuation of the epidural anesthesia and
minimization of sedating medications. Her blood pressures were
occasionally low, but responsive to conservative management with
hydration. She did not require pressure support. On HD #4, she
was medically stable and transferred to the floor. Psychiatry
was consulted and reccomended inpatient psychiatric admission.
She remained medically stable throughout the rest of her course,
and was deemed safe for discharge to inpatient psychiatry on
hospital day number 6.

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**8-12**]: PRE-CPB: There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include hypokinesis of the distal
inferolateral, lateral, and anterolateral walls. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
CXR [**8-15**]: 1. New very small left apical pneumothorax following
chest tube removal. 2. Slight decrease in right apical
pneumothorax with residual small pneumothorax. 3. Stable
postoperative widening of cardiac contour, likely due to
postoperative pericardial effusion, as this is a change from the
preoperative radiograph.

HIV meds were resumed and they continued to see him throughout
hospital course.  On post-operative day two he was transferred
to the cardiac telemetry floor. Beta blockers and diuretics were
started and he was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On
post-op day three his chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires
were removed. Chest x-ray after chest tube removal revealed
small apical pneumothoraces. Physical therapy followed pt during
entire post-op course for strength and mobility. Repeat chest
x-ray on post-op day four revealed resolvd pneumothoraces. He
was cleared by infectious diseases for discharge, and will be
followed closely by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient. He was discharged
home with VNA services on post-op day 4 with the appropriate

   .
   He was admitted to [**Hospital 880**] Hospital on [**2141-8-1**] from [**Location (un) 3083**] Jail
   after being arrested for public intoxication and developing hematemesis
   and falling in jail.  On presentation to their ED, his initial VS were
   HR 127, BP 103/98. His Hct was 20.  He had an episode of coffee ground
   emesis and an NGT was placed with aspiration of 300 cc dark red blood
   and coffee grounds.  He also underwent an abdominal CT that
   demonstrated cirrhosis with severe esophageal varices extending to the
   portal vein and a head CT that was negative.  His CXR was read as ? LLL
   consolidation vs atelectasis, and he was started on octreotide and a
   PPI drip and admitted to the MICU for further management.
   .
   He underwent EGD on [**8-1**] with grade I esophogeal varices but no active
   bleeding, though there were stigmata of recent bleeding.  Six bands
   were placed.  He then was noted to be acutely sedated in the setting of
   receiving diazepam for ? withdrawal and underwent head CT that
   afternoon, which was again read as negative.  However, afterward, he
   had recurrent hematemesis.  He was intubated and lost approximately
   800cc of blood.  He underwent emergent EGD at this point, which was
   complicated by episodes of hypoxia; however, blood was found in the
   entire esophagus and no clear site of bleeding was noted, though bands
   appeared to have come loose.  He had a witnessed aspiration event and
   was started on imipenem emperically for aspiration pna and variceal
   bleeding.  He did receive ciprofloxacin on [**8-1**].  Total transfusions
   were 10u PRBC and 8u FFP, with 15 mg IV/SC vitamin K.  Because of
   continued bleeding and need for a possible [**Last Name (un) 3755**] or TIPS procedure,
   he was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**].

   On arrival, he was hemodynamically stable and scoped emergently by GI,
   with demonstration of no active bleeding.  Last ABG prior to transfer
   was 7.42/32/85 on CMV rate 16 PEEP 5 VT 450 FIO2 80%.

more depressed recently secondary to financial issues. Due to
not enough money, she had not taken her prozac for almost 2
weeks as she was unable to fill script and pay for the
medication. She OD'd on 105 tablets of benadryl, to ensure the
dose would be lethal. Denies OD of prozac and OCP, as she has

protection. Initially, in the ED she was tachycardiac to 148,
had an AG of 19 and lactate of 10. She received 50 g of charcoal
and 4 L of NS in the ED and then sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
she was managed supportively and extubated without complications
yesterday. Now transferred to the medical service as stable for

whitish to yellow phlegm. No f/c/s, although the patient felt
hot and flushed earlier. No CP, SOB, n/v, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, dysuria, swelling in extremities. Last BM was
yesterday night.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P The patient is a 36 year old man with extensive alcohol
history presenting with signs and symptoms of withdrawal
.
# Alcohol withdrawal/Intoxication - improving with decreased
tremors and normalizing vital signs. Long history of etoh
addiction with multiple admissions for withdrawals puts him at
high risk for severe DTs. other possible although less likely
etiologies for altered mental status and agitation could include
hepatic encephalopathy or additional ingestion beyond etoh and
benzos. however LFTs at baseline and no expansion in osm gap
(calc osm 363) or AG to suggest another organic alcohol
ingestion.  He was covered by CIWA scale, for which he required
a large amount of valium, more for subjective than objective
measures.  He threatened to leave AMA on the evening of [**2180-12-27**]
because he felt he could better treat himself with alcohol or
listerine.  He was convinced to stay for more monitoring and
withdrawal treatment, but then signed out AMA on the morning of
[**2180-12-28**].
.
# Anxiety - per most recent psych notes patient would benefit
from seroquel standing and prn for anxiety without evidence of
DTs.  He was given seroquel qhs.
.
# Hand pain - likely related to chronic cold weather exposure vs
reflex sympathetic dystrophy given skin color changes.  He was
given gabapentin tid.
.
# Mild Abd pain: Likely [**3-10**] to drinking listerine vs whole body
myalgias from withdrawal. LFT's WNL for this patient. Guiac
negative and HCT relatively stable at patient's baseline. No
rebound or guarding to suggest surgical abdomen, hemodynamically
stable.  Amylase elevated but decreased from [**12-24**]. Lipase
mildly elevated.

# FEN: change daily IVF with folate/MVI/thiamin/dextrose to PO
fluids and vitmains. clears and advance diet slowly

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 34 yo male with PMH polysubstance abuse, hx of withdrawal
seizures, DTs, Hep C, mult psychiatric issues presents with
acute etoh intoxication and concerns for withdrawal given
previous h/o DT.
.
1. ETOH withdrawal: Pt was seen in the ED with an EtOH level of
388.  Pt was quite agitated and required 120mg IV of valium in
the ED (along with receiving thiamine/folate/MVI). Pt was
aggressively managed with IV valium given his h/o of seizures
and DTs.  Due to his high IV valium requirement pt was admitted
to the ICU for better monitoring and frequent IV valium
infusions.  Pt never had any withdrawal seizures or DTs
throughout this admission.  Pt was eventually weaned to a PO
regimen (10mg po q1hr prn ciwa>10) and transferred to the floors
on a round the clock PO valium schedule for CIWA > 10.  After
3-4 days of treatment, pt remained agitated and jittery, and
after being seen by the BEST and psychiatric team it was felt
that likely pt was suffering from baseline anxiety and would
benefit from a stay at a detox facility that may address dual
diagnosis with psychosis.  Psych team also recommended tapering
off Valium, and starting Zyprexa 2.5mg po qD, 2.5mg po prn as
needed for agitation.  At time of discharge, pt was decreased
down to Valium 20mg po q6, and left on Zyprexa 2.5mg po daily.
Pt's psych medications would be titrated as needed by [**Hospital1 **]
facility.
.
2. Elevated LFTs: Likely secondary to chronic HCV vs. mild etoh
induced hepatitis.  No sign of acute hepatitis during this
hospitalization.  No other intervention was required.
.
3. Elevated Lipase: Likely secondary to ETOH abuse or mild
pancreatitis in setting of ETOH.  Pt with a CT abd during this
admission that was negative. Pt continued to be abd pain free
during this admission, and pt was tolerating general diet.  No
abx were given during this hospital stay.
.
4. Psych: Pt has mult psych issues including OCD, anxiety, and
depression.
Currently off all meds [**3-11**] non-compliance.  BEST and psychiatry
closely following during this admission, and recommended Zyprexa
standing as well as prn to better control his anxiety (see
above).  Psychiatry also recommended that patient be sent to a
psych facility (ie [**Hospital1 **]) after discharge to better address
his psych issues.
.
5. DISPO:  Pt without any sign of etoh withdrawal during this
admission.  Pt was administered large doses of Valium although
unlikely that pt's baseline anxiety was from etoh withdrawal.
Pt was switched to an oral Zyprexa regimen to better manage his
sx's per psych and Valium taper was begun.  Pt was discharged to
[**Hospital1 **] for further psych/addiction managment.

IMPRESSION:
1. No CT evidence of intra-abdominal parenchymal organ injury.

2. Small amount of pericholecystic fluid. No radiopaque stone or
gallbladder wall thickening is appreciated to suggest
cholecystitis.

3. Mild stranding within the retroperitoneum adjacent to the
right kidney, which is likely related to contusion of a short
segement of ascending colon. Small focus of stranding of omentum
anterior to transverse colon in RUQ, also likely contusion.

4. Extensive stranding within soft tissues adjacent to the right
iliac crest and buttocks. Small focus of high density within
this area of contusion, likely related to small vessel injury.

5. Numerous old rib fractures with acute right 5th and 6th rib
fractures. Tiny bilateral pneumothoraces are present with
secondary small locules of air in the mediastinum and adjacent
to the diaphragm. Size of each is very small, likely not needing
chest tube decomnpression, however note is made of intubated
state.


Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was evaluated and immediately rescusitated in the [**Hospital1 18**];
appropriate CTs and plain films were immediately obtained.  The
patient remained intubated and sedated with an OGT placed.

     The patient was evaluated by neurosurgery for a left
frontal subdural hematoma.  The patient was admitted to the
trauma ICU, and per their recommendations, his blood pressure
was tightly controlled, hourly neuro checks were performed, and
the patient was put on dilantin.

The patient was put on DT prophylaxis (CIWA scale), and received
thiamine, folate, and a multivitamins.  Benzos were gradually
weaned for alcohol detoxification during his stay

His sedation was gradually weaned as well as his vent settings
until the patient was safely extubated. The patient received
adequate pain control for rib pain, and pulmonary toilet
throughout his stay.  He had no other pulmonary complications.

His stay was complicated by intermittent periods of confusion,
disorientation, and instability standing.  At one point, the
patient fell face down on the floor; a head CT and full
neurologic exam was performed with no abnormal results.  The
patient was closely followed for any changes in neurologic
status.

When appropriate, his diet was advanced, and his Foley catheter
was removed.  The patient tolerated both well with no further
issues.  The patient was routinely evaluated and treated by both
physical and occupational therapy, as well as social work.  The
patient was discharged home with pain well controlled,
tolerating diet, ambulating without assistance, and voiding
independently.  The patient was given appropriate discharge
information (see following).

1.  Alcohol overdose: pt s/p large amount of alcohol with
benadryl/atenolol, s/p intubation for airway protection and
overnight MICU stay for observation, received charcoal in the
ED, now extubated and doing well. He was maintained on CIWA
scale as well as on standing valium.  He required 45 mg valium 1
day post-extubation.  He was then put on 10 mg TID and tapered
accordingly. He did not require additional valium as per CIWA,
was stable hemodynamically, with no signs of DT's/autonomic
instability.  He was started on MVI/thiamine/folate supplements.
 He continued to deny any suicidal ideations and denied that his
overdose was a suicide attempt.  As per psych, he has a history
of changing his story/lying, and it was felt that he required
further psychiatric hospitalization. He was screened by BEST and

water deficit (D5W) and Na 140 on transfer to the floor.  He
likely had hyponatremic hyponatremia which responded to fluid
resuscitation. His hyponatremia remained stable throughout the
rest of his hospitalization.

4.  HTN: Initially held BP meds, and Atenolol was restarted on
discharge.  His PCP should address with him the possibility of
adding a second bp [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for better control.

changes, atenolol was continued on discharge, and pt with no
more symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
 59 year old male presented to [**Hospital 14663**] Hospital on [**2118-3-16**]
with the worst headache of his life and left sided-weakness. He
walked into the ER there and quickly decompensated. The patient
required intubation because he became obtunded and his right
pupil became unreactive. He was also posturing. The CT scan
showed a large
right IPH and SDH. He was then transferred to our facility.
 Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was determined to require emergent
right hemicraniectomy for a large right frontal intracranial
hemorrhage.  On [**3-18**], his repeated CT scan was stable, with
improved post-surgical changes.  He did have an angiogram
performed that identified an anterior communicating aneurysm
(not related to the bleed).
 [**3-19**] he was extubated however required reintubation
secondary to being unable to tolerate his secretions. He was
then given repeated trials to wean off the vent but was
unsuccessful. He was therefore taken for a PEG and trach on
[**3-24**]. Afterwards he was successfully weaned off the vent.

In the interim, the path report returned and it showed a likely
GBM. This was discussed with the patient and his family with his
permission. He was taken back to the OR on [**3-30**] for a flap
replacement. He will follow-up with neurosurgery as an
outpatient as well as for XRT.

   540 in [**3-/2186**], HIV VL [**Numeric Identifier 8108**]) and history of polysubstance abuse, who
   presents with altered mental status.  Mr. [**Known lastname 3447**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8107**] arrived at
   his parents' residence 1 day prior to admission around noon with
   paranoia regarding stressful living situation (he lives with his male
   partner and another roommate who is supposedly a difficult roommate).
   He went to bed at midnight and was isolated until 6 AM.  His father, a
   psychiatrist, found him half  hanging off the cough, picking at things,
   doing ""stereotactic"" movements, ? VH, babbling.  Per father, he
   appeared very dry and could not focus.  His father thought maybe he was
   having a bad dream, but couldn't wake him up.  He was noted to be more
   rigid with more incoherent babbling. Dad is a psychiatrist and believed
   that this did not look like a seizure or post-ictal state.  Dad states
   he does not know of any seizure history.  He took the patient by
   ambulance to be evaluated at the ED at 7:30 AM. Of note, the patient
   has been clean and sober for 6-7 months with a history of multiple drug
   use and crystal meth use.

   vancomycin 1 gm IV x 1 was given prior to LP. Prior to LP, ativan 2 mg
   IV x 1 given. LP performed.  Toxicology was consulted in the ED as
   patient noted to be flushed, warm, but never febrile, tachycardic, and
   mydriatic.  Tox believed pt presentation was c/w anticholinergic
   toxicity and recommended supportive management.  The patient was given
   2 mg IV ativan x 1 again.  Pt was originally to go to medical floor,
   but on reevaluation by toxicology team, he was noted to be unresponsive
   to sternal rub. He was noted to desat 85% on RA. NRB placed with O2 sat
   99% then down to 94-96%.  He was intubated for airway protection with
   etomidate 20 mg IV x 1 and succ 130 mg IV x 1.  Toxicology then
   recommended serial EKGs as QRS widened at 100.  Per ED, serial EKG does

   Additional Information:
   Patient / Family Assessment: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 276**] admitted this 24 y/o women with
   altered mental status in transfer from [**Hospital3 **] after having been
   taken their last night. Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 8495**] said that [**Doctor Last Name **] called her
   yesterday as he stood outside the couple's apartment for
two hours
   trying to get Ms. [**Known lastname 8494**] to open the door. He saw her through a window
   lying on one sofa moving her arms. She then was out of sight but soon
   returned naked and lay down on another sofa and apparently was
   unconscious. Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 8495**] called 911 because [**Doctor Last Name **] refused to do so,
   which she said she did not understand because he knows that she has
   been depressed and had attempted suicide.
   In [**Name (NI) 349**], pt went to [**Country 8489**] and married a man that was initially
   identified as [**Doctor Last Name 8504**] younger brother. [**Name (NI) **] they said that in [**Country 4347**]
   ""everyone is family"" and they are ""cousins."" [**Name2 (NI) **] in [**Country 8489**], her now
   17 month old baby developed malaria and was apparently successfully TX.
   Pt was also found to have malaria but did not respond successfully to
   TX. Since returning later in [**Month (only) 349**] or [**Month (only) 8**] to the states, pt has lost
   ""50 lbs,"" has had ""headaches and pain all over,"" and ""would not eat;""
   when she did eat, she ""threw-up"" and said that ""everything tasted
   bitter.""
   After her return, Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 8495**] reports that she and [**Doctor Last Name **] often fought
   because ""he was jealous"" that she had gotten married. (Neither her
   husband nor is [**Name (NI) **] is the father of her child.) Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 8495**] said
   that the pt called her in [**Month (only) 1646**] to come over because [**Doctor Last Name **] was hitting
   her. When she arrived, she called the police because ""[**Doctor Last Name **] had beat
   her so bad."" The police charged him but neither Ms. [**Known lastname 8494**] nor she
   went to court, so the case was finally dropped. Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 8495**] said that
   the couple had gotten back together and she ""did not want to be in the
   middle"" of their relationship. In response to this assault, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 8502**]
   said that DSS removed the pt
s daughter, who [**Name (NI) **] reportedly also
   assaulted. Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 8502**] says of the pt, ""She comes from a simple life but

   SW met with pt who came to this country two years ago from [**Country 1773**] when
   she won a lottery for a Green Card. Although she states that life in
   her country was
good,
 she felt that life would be better in the
   States.
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8494**] reports that she is currently doing okay, complaining
   primarily about headaches that hurt more when she sits up. Pt
   acknowledged having made a suicide gesture with a knife, but she did
   not mention trying to hang herself, which her friend [**Name (NI) 866**] reported
   when interviewed following pt
s transfer from OSH. She said that she
   had made the attempt in response to DCF having removed her daughter,
   which occurred three months ago. She did not say why the agency had
   taken such action. ([**Doctor First Name 866**] states that DCF removed her because [**Doctor Last Name **]
   was physically abusing the pt and child.) Ms. [**Known lastname 8494**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5614**] her
   daughter once a week where she resides in a [**Doctor Last Name 3777**] home; at the end of
   the fourth month, she reports, DCF will let her resuming living with
   her. Presently, Ms. [**Known lastname 8494**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8650**] being somewhat depressed, but
   she did not explain why.
   Asked if she had spoken with her husband, Ms. [**Known lastname 8494**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8024**] being
   married, which [**Doctor First Name 866**] reported. Pt said that she has not spoken to her
   boyfriend, [**Name (NI) **], who she denies having abused her, again
   contradicting [**Doctor First Name 866**].
   Assessment:
   It was difficult for SW to assess the degree to which her behavior,
   such as difficulty in recalling and long pauses before responding,
   might be cognitive versus psychological. Nursing reports that when
   friends visit, Ms. [**Known lastname 8494**] is very animated and interactive.
   Plan:
   1.       To continue to meet with pt to assess her psychosocial
   functioning.
   2.       To try and meet with pt and [**Doctor First Name 866**] to explore some of the above
   stated contradictions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was initially admitted to the ICU for close monitoring
of his alcohol withdrawal.  He did require significant amounts
of valium.  On the second day of admission, the patient was felt
to be safe for transfer to the medical floor.  He was continued
on his CIWA scale with valium.  On the morning after transfer.
The patient signed out AMA from the hospital.  The medical team
explained the risks of leaving the hospital, including death, or
other injuries from withdrawal from alcohol.  He voiced
understanding of these risks and signed out AMA.

   by EMS, having been found down in the streets.  Pt  initially admitted
   to medical floor, but needed transfer to MICU to adequately manage
   withdrawal.
   Reviewed OMR notes.  Pt has been seen extensively by sw and psych on
   past admissions and multiple attempts have been made to help pt ,
   including gathering street outreach workers to meet with [**Hospital1 54**] sw and
   psych to collaborate on managing pt.  Most recently, pt was sectioned

Pt and family referred to sw by MICU team for coping support.  Pt is a 31 yo wom

quently admitted to MICU 7 with benzo withdrawal.  Pt also being followed by psy
chiatry and being recommended for likely inpt psych admission for dual dx tx upo

SW met with pt
s mother, [**Name (NI) 4396**], at pt
s bedside this afternoon.  Pt laying in b
ed, sleeping soundly.  Mother reports pt has a 7 year hx of substance abuse/rx d
rugs that has come to a head more in the past few years.  She notes pt moved out
 to CA about 10 years ago to try to get into acting career, but was hard to [**Last Name (un) **]
k in.  Mother shares that she (mother) was unaware that pt had been using drugs
until last year and mother went out to CA to visit pt and got her into a drug re
hab.  Mother reports pt did well in rehab and was motivated to continue going to
 meetings, getting a sponsor, etc and decided to return to [**Location (un) **] to continue he
r recovery.  Mother notes that when pt returned to [**Location **], she never followed up
 on these plans.  She notes pt has out pt psychiatrist in [**Location (un) **] but has hardly
seen him.  Mother notes that she (mother) had been in [**Name (NI) 503**] this past week and
 had been noticing pt
s bizarre behavior over the phone and asked pt
s sister an
d aunt to intervene.  She also contact[**Name (NI) **] pt
s psychiatrist who recommended pt co
me to [**Hospital1 5**].  Mother reports pt came after much coaxing.
Mother describes pt as a very private person who is very ashamed of the way her
life has turned out.  She shares that pt has struggled watching all her friends
get established as she has not been able to break into the acting world.  Mother
 shares she is pt
s primary support and that pt is very private and secretive ab
out her life and does not want mother to talk about to with people.  She reports
 pt lives with her and her husband in their home in [**Name (NI) 2558**] and that they are cur
rently supporting her financially as pt has not been able to work.
Mother reports she is coping well given circumstances.  She shares having strong
 support from her husband (not pt
s biological father who has never really been
involved in pt
s life), pt
s sister and friends.  She shares normative feelings
of sadness, frustration and powerlessness in dealing with pt
s struggles with ad
diction and depression.  She shares she has never gotten formal/professional sup
port for this and does not feel the need to, but really hopes pt will get suppor
t she needs upon dc.
While meeting with sw, mother got call from her other dtr/pt
s sister who report
s she found a bottle of rx vicaden that was recently prescribed by her former pc
p in CA.  Mother understandably angered by this and stating that she had wondere
d where pt was getting drugs and suspected that MDs in CA had been rx
ing.
SW provided emotional support to mother.  Normalized feelings and proved psycho
ed re: dealing with addiction and depression as family member.  Explained sw rol
e and function and provided mother with sw contact info if needed.
Mother appears to be coping well given circumstances.  Seems understandably sadd
ened but also frustrated and angered by situation.  While mother could likely be
nefit from out pt formal support in coping with dtr, she is not open to it at th
is time.  However, she seemed quite receptive to sw intervention while pt in pt.

Chief Complaint:
Need for surgical repair of left zygomaticomaxillary complex
fracture and left orbital floor blowout fracture.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left ZMC and orbital floor fracture repairs


History of Present Illness:
This is a 24 year old male who was originally admitted to the
Trauma service on [**2106-6-25**] s/p assault with multiple facial
fractures and left subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and a large
left subgaleal hematoma.  Patient was recovering well and was
transferred to Plastics service on [**2106-6-29**] for repair of his
facial fractures.  He was scheduled for those repairs on [**2106-6-30**]
and NPO for surgery when at approximately 3 a.m. the morning of
[**6-30**], he became agitated and despite efforts to keep in with us
for surgery, he suddenly signed out AMA.  He was able to return
directly home to his parent's home in [**Location (un) 246**] where he decided to
eat a cookie.  They were able to convince him to return to the
hospital where they brought him to the ER at a little bit before
7am for purposes of keeping with the surgical plan.  Due to the
fact that he had eaten a cookie prior to returning to the
hospital, his surgery on [**6-30**] had to be delayed further into the
day.

Past Medical History:
left subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [**2106-6-25**]
Left zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture [**2106-6-25**]
Left orbital floor blowout fracture [**2106-6-25**]
right inferior orbital wall fracture [**2106-6-25**]


Social History:
Self reported abuse of heroin and prescriptive medications over
the past three years or so.  Possibly participating in a needle
exchange program (card was found in his pocket but not sure
where this was from).  Possible ETOH abuse. Smokes 1 PPD x past
10 years. Parents did have a formal restraining order in the
recent past so he could not come to the house but they did have
that lifted recently.  He has been in prison in the past, has
gone through rehab programs and was living in a halfway house in
the past.  He has recently been homeless and living on the
streets with a girlfried named 'KiKi' who witnessed the assault,
fled the scene, and then waited 12 hours to call his parents to
let them know what happened.

Final Report
EXAM: Non-contrast-enhanced CT of the head.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: 24-year-old male with history of altered
mental status and agitation, history of recent subarachnoid
hemorrhage, evaluate for new acute intracranial hemorrhage.
COMPARISON: Multiple priors, including [**2106-6-27**], [**2106-6-25**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast-enhanced CT of the head was performed.
Reformatted
coronal and sagittal images were also obtained.
FINDINGS: Again seen is evolving/resolving subarachnoid
hemorrhage along the corpus callosum, best seen on the coronal
and sagittal images, slightly decreased in amount as compared to
[**2106-6-25**]. No new acute intracranial hemorrhage is seen. There is
no mass effect, midline shift, or hydrocephalus. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. Mucosal thickening is seen
in the ethmoid air cells and maxillary sinuses.  Multiple facial
fractures are not fully included or optimally evaluated and are
better assessed on prior maxillofacial CT from [**2106-6-25**]. These
include fractures involving left zygomaticomaxillary complex and
left and possibly right orbit. The maxillary sinuses are not
fully imaged on the current study. Evidence of large left
subgaleal hematoma is again seen. There has been interval
decrease in size in the right subgaleal hematoma as compared to
[**2106-6-25**], without significant change from [**2106-6-27**].
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Resolving/evolving subarachnoid hemorrhage layering along the
corpus
callosum, with interval decrease since [**2106-1-26**]. No new
intracranial hemorrhage seen.
2. Facial and orbital fractures, not fully included and
incompletely
evaluated, better evaluated on recent dedicated maxillofacial
CT. Large left subgaleal hematoma again noted.



Brief Hospital Course:
 In the ER, the patient became increasingly agitated despite
multiple conversations and attempts to calm him with Ativan and
Haldol.  For his safety and the safety of others, the patient
was then placed in seclusion/restraints due to the imminent
threat of Self Harm. The patient's response to the intervention
was agitated (Combative).  It was felt that this behavior was
not typical and may have represented a change in mental status
related to an unstable SAH which had previously been stable.  He
was sent for an urgent head CT but was non-compliant with
staying still.  Due to the fact that he needed an urgent head CT
and was likely going to go for surgical repair of his facial
fractures, the decision was made to sedate and intubate the
patient for his own safety.  This was discussed with the
patient's father and all parties were in agreement.  The patient
underwent the head CT which showed a stable left SAH and stable
large left subgaleal hematoma.  Neurosurgery saw the patient and
the head CT and gave clearance for facial fracture repair
surgery with plastics.  Patient underwent ORIF of left facial
fractures on the afternoon of [**2106-6-30**] and tolerated the
procedure well.  He spent the night intubated in in our trauma
ICU.  He was extubated and transferred to the floor on [**2106-7-1**]
where he was maintained on sinus precautions and started on
Seroquel PRN for agitation.  At this time a 'Psych consult' was
called for help with etiologies of agitated behaviors.  They
felt as though confusion/delerium and agitation may be related
to head injury or seizures.  On [**7-1**], Psych again met with
patient and found him to have some suicidal ideation.  They felt
he lacked the capacity to make informed medical decisions, such
as leaving AMA, and would likely require dual diagnosis
following medical stabilization and resolution of delirium.  On
[**2106-7-2**], the Medicine team was also consulted for help with
etiology/management of delerium.  They felt medications,
withdrawal and infection could all be causes of delirium.  On
[**2106-7-3**], Psych again saw the patient and felt that his mental
status appeared
to be improving quite a bit, with only minimal attentional
deficits. He denied any SI/HI to them, but appeared ambivalent
about what was best for his care. Collateral
info from his family suggested significant safety concerns and
depressive symptoms along with severe substance use disorder
that has been ongoing.  Based on the above information, Psych
felt that the patient appeared appropriate for dual-dx level of
care for stabilization and treatment. They also felt he met
section 12 criteria based on risk to self.  They recommended
inpatient dual diagnosis admission and BEST was called to assist
with dispo.  Patient had 1:1 sitter for safety and a Section 12
was placed in chart.  Patient was maintained with 1:1 sitter and
on PRN Seroquel, ativan and haldol.  His seroquel was increased
from 25mg po TID PRN, to 50mg po QID PRN to 100mg PO QID PRN.
On Monday, [**2106-7-5**] patient became agitated, refusing meds and
insisting he was going to leave.  Psych RN was called and after
assessment she felt that [**Hospital1 18**] security needed to be in
attendance.  Patient very upset and saying 'I'd rather be in
jail than here'.  Emotional support was provided to patient by
RNs, Psych RN, Psych MD, sitter, Plastics team and [**Hospital1 18**]
Security.  Patient eventually settled down and the BEST team is
screening him for placement to a facility which he has currently
agreed to.  This patient is medically cleared to be discharged
to a facility that is better able to manage his current
psychosocial needs.

Chief Complaint:
Chronic leg edema and shortness or breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2105-5-22**] Pericardectomy

History of Present Illness:
53 y/o male with h/o constrictive pericarditis with unknown
etiology for approx. 10 years who presented to OSH with leg and
scrotal edema. He is also c/o shortness of breath and PND.
Patient was diursed and underwent cardiac cath which was
consistent with preicardial constriction. He has refused surgery
in the past, but now agrees and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgery.

Past Medical History:
Constrictive Pericarditis, Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension,
Obesity, Left Eye blindness

Social History:
Homeless, Quit smoking 2 months ago. 70 pack/yr hx. Denies ETOH.

Ext: Warm, 4+ bilat. LE edema, -varicosities
Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, non-focal

Pertinent Results:
[**2105-5-22**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). There appears to be focal left and right
ventricular apical hypokinesis but poor apical windows prevent
complete evaluation. There is abnormal septal motion suggestive
of pericardial constriction. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is
a strand-like echodensity on the left ventricular outflow tract
side of either the left or non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve
that likely represents a degredative process but an aortic valve
vegetation mass cannot be excluded. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There
is a very large left pleual effusion as well as a right pleural
effusion and ascites. After stripping of the pericardium there
were no major changes. The pleural effusions were drained.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgical management. He underwent usual pre-operative lab work
on day of admission. On [**5-22**] he was brought to the operating
room where he underwent a pericardectomy. Please see operative
report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one he was
started on beta blockers and diuretics. ID consulted on Mr.
[**Known lastname **] to help determine plan and to determine reason for
constrictive pericarditis (r/o TB as cause). On post-op day one
he appeared to be doing well and was transferred to the
telemetry floor. Over the next several days he worked with
physical therapy for strength and mobility. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. He was
diuresed and medically managed during these days and awaited
results of tissue microbiology which were all negative.  He
continued to diurese well.

History of Present Illness:
36 year old homeless man with h/o polysubstance abuse and
frequent admissions who signed out AMA yesterday morning after
two admissions over the past 4 days for alcohol intoxication. At
the most recent admission, the patient required intubation for
altered mental status.
.
He was BIBA after found to be ataxic and intoxicated. BAL 279
and urine tox positive for benzos and cocaine. In the ED,
received multiple doses of valium, ativan, haldol and a banana
bag. He repeatedly wanted to leave the ED to return to the
street to drink but had reportedly endorsed SI overnight to
staff. Psychiatry was consulted who eventually determined no
active SI and cleared the patient for discharge. However, at
that time he was reportedly ataxic and actively withdrawing with
hallucinations (hearing ""echos"" and complained of his skin
crawling). Therefore, Psych recommended inpatient admission for
EtOH withdrawal. SW was consulted re: possible section 35
(mandated court ordered detox) but stated that it would be
difficult to obtain over the weekend and was non-emergent. he
was then transferred to the ICU for further management of his
withdrawal.
.
Currently he states that he is quite unhappy. He states that
past attempts at detox have been unsuccessful. He states that no
sooner does he get released that he returns to the streets and
begins to drink again. He feels that his situation is hopeless.
Though he states that he is not actively suicidal, he does feel
like he would not mind is he just died. Patient states that he
does not want to go to rehab because he cannot handle having to
deal with so many people [**3-10**] to his social phobia. Cimialry, he
states that he does not derive any benefit from AA. Patient
states that he is willing to try detox here and is willing to
talk to social work and case management to see what other
options exist.

Brief Hospital Course:
35 year old male with history of alcohol abuse admitted with
alcohol withdrawal

1. Alcohol abuse/withdrawal - The patient was admitted to the
intensive care unit and loaded with substantial doses of Valium
with good effect. He was transferred to the general medical
floor, and his valium dose was tapered. At time of discharge, he
had no evidence of alcohol withdrawal. The social work,
psychiatry, and addictions service followed the patient closely
throughout his hospital stay. He was screened for sober
houses/drug treatment programs and was discharged to the STARS
program.

2. Depression - The patient was evaluated by the psychiatry
service, who did not not feel that the patient was actively
suicidal. They followed him closely throughout his hospital
stay, and he was started for risperidone for anxiety.

3. Hepatitis C - The patient's transaminitis gradually improved,
suggesting some component of alcoholic hepatitis. He is not
currently a candidate for interferon therapy given recent active
alcohol use. His PCP may consider referring him to liver clinic
to discuss treatment options.

4. Bilateral hand pain - Recent ([**4-/2180**]) x-rays of both hands
showed only mild degenerative changes.  Rheumatology was
consulted and felt his symptoms were consistent with neuropathy,
possibly due to alcohol use.  The patient was started on
gabapentin, which was gradually titrated up. He also received
Ultram as needed for pain.

42 year old male with a history of hepatitis C and polysubstance
abuse (cocaine, benzodiazepines, heroin) presents with an
opiate/valium overdose.

1) Altered MS / Overdose: He admits to taking methadone at the
clinic as scheduled. He recently had his doctor write a script
for valium, and he took most of the bottle yesterday. He also
took cocaine, but denies heroin since starting methadone. He was
intially placed on a narcan gtt in ED. Upon tranfer to the
floor, narcan gtt was stopped and patient more alert. Repeat
urine tox was still positive for benzos, opioids, methadone, and
cocaine. Of note, per pathology, levaquin can cause false
positives for opioids. The patient was restarted on methadone
(55 mg, confirmed with methadone clinic) and, at time of
discharge, had no evidence of withdrawal. Social work followed
the patient throughout his hospital course. The patient
expressed a desire for drug rehabilitation and, at time of
discharge, he was on several waiting lists.

2) Community acquired pneumonia: The patient completed a 10 day
course of levofloxacin (sputum culture grew MSSA sensitive to
levofloxacin) and, at time of discharge was afebrile with stable
O2 saturation on room air. Additional infectious work-up
included blood, urine, CSF cultures, all of which are negative
to date.

3) Hepatitis C: The patient had mild ALT/AST elevation on
admission, which was normalizing at time of discharge. A right
upper quadrant ultrasound was without evidence of biliary
dilitation. He will follow-up with liver clinic as an

Brief Hospital Course:
37yoM hx alcoholism, multiple admits for detox and hx of

admitted to MICU for ethanol withdrawal and monitoring.
.
# ETOH intoxication/AMS: 37 y.o male with history of
polysubstance abues and multiple previous admits for detox/drug
seeking behavior. He presented intoxicated and became very
agitated in the ED requiring multiple sedating medications. The
patient was given a total of 40mg of valium in the ED.  In the
ICU, he was given an additionl 5mg valium for anxiety. He was
also given thiamine, folate, and a multivitamin.  Social work
was also contact[**Name (NI) **].
  The patient was transferred to the medicine floor and on the
am of [**4-1**] definitely appeared to be in clinical ETOH withdrawal
(despite his well-documented history of faking ETOH withdrawal
symptoms for benzos).  The patient was aggressivley treated with
200 mg of valium in 9 hours and then determined to no longer
have any clinical evidence of ETOH withdrawal (involuntary
tremors).
  However, the patient became very agitated and anxious.  The
patient was again evaluated by the medicine attending and
clearly deemed to not be in ETOH withdrawal anymore.  His
agitation and anxiety was now behavioral.
  The patient's femoral line was removed with plan to monitor
overnight and d/c in am after shower with taxi voucher.
  The patient shortly thereafter eloped from the hospital.
  I would highly advocate that when the patient returns to [**Hospital1 18**]
that he be section 25'd.

History of Present Illness:
44 yo M with long psych history, depression, anxiety, h/o
narcotic abuse, cocaine, IVDA, panic attacks, DM type 2, hep C
(not treated, not followed here at liver service),
hypothyroidism, a fib who comes in with multiple complaints.
Almoost all of these complaints started on Monday, a time in
which he was also having to move residences because his
relationship was breaking up. All around this same time he had
nausea, intermittent episodes of squeezing chest pain worse with
inhalation (lasting about 20 minutes or so), crampy abdominal
pain, and nausea. He vomited 1-2 times and says that he vomited
some blood. He states that he had some loose, dark black stools;
his stools were guiaic positive but brown in ED. + chills, night
sweats, no fevers. Non-productive cough. In the ED he gave a
history of L sided pleuritic CP radiating to neck X 3 days.
Unable to eat due to poor appetite and nausea. Has not taken any
insulin with FS in 300s. L leg numbness and tingling since
Monday without back pain. +knee buckling; a neighbor saw him
fall, and called EMS. Last EtOH 1 month ago, denies any drug
abuse. But tox screen positive - pt admits to xanax, percocet,
tramadol.
.
In the ED BP 115/58, HR 92, RR 20, O2 sat 100% on RA. He was
tachycardic to 106, with some afib noted in the ED but not on
EKG; BPs nl, O2 sat 100%. Guaiac pos soft brown stool, good
rectal tone. Would not tolerate NGL. Some decreased sensation to
L4 dermatome. Got 3 L IVFs. EKG without ischemic changes, trops
negative.  Labs were also significant for Hct 37.5, BUN 72, Cr
1.3, CK 4011, D-dimer 2670, urine tox positive for benzos and
opiates. An EKG was negative for any ischemic changes. Pt
refused NGL, seen by GI who recommended PPI, serial Hcts, and
EGD in am.
.
Given elevated d-dimer and pt's reported contrast dye allergy,
V/Q scan performed that was mod probability for PE (subsegmental
V/Q mismatch in superior aspect of b/l upper lobes and posterior
basal segment of LLL). Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVT. He
was given 3L IVFs, protonix 40 mg IV X 1, morphine 6 mg IV,
zofran 4 mg IV X 2, and 4 units regular insulin for FS 241.
Given the ED's concern for not having a clear explanation for
the pt's multiple complaints, and given that some of these
complaints might point to acute problems, he was admitted to the
ICU for closer monitoring.

Port CXR [**12-13**] - Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
There is no pleural effusion.  Osseous structures are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

V/Q Scan [**12-13**] - Subsegmental perfusion/ventilation mismatch
involving the superior segments of both upper lobes and the
posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe.  Findings
represent a moderate probability for pulmonary embolus of
undetermined chronicity.  If clinically indicated, further
evaluation with lower extremity ultrasound to assess for DVT and
a repeat VQ scan in 24-48 hours could be performed.

INTERPRETATION:
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views
demonstrate no
abnormalities.

Perfusion images in the same 8 views show no areas of decreased
perfusion.

Chest x-ray shows no areas of consolidation.

The above findings are consistent with a normal study.

IMPRESSION: Interval resolution of previously seen
perfusion/ventilation
subsegmental defects. Normal study.


Brief Hospital Course:
44 yo M with hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, PAF, depression,
anxiety, and h/o past narcotic, benzo, and IVDA who presents to
the ED with multiple complaints including L pleuritic chest
pain, nausea, possible hematemesis and melena, found to have
intermediate probability study for PE on V/Q scan, admitted to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close observation overnight.
.
# L chest pain - Described as pleuritic in nature with elevated
d-dimer to 2670 in ED. V/Q scan with subsegmental V/Q mismatch
in superior segments of both upper lobes and in posterior basal
segment of LLL. Bilateral LENIs negative for evidence of DVT.
Otherwise, clinical suspicion for acute PE is relatively low
given lack of hypoxia, no EKG changes (S1Q3T3). Pt is
tachycardic, but there are other possible explanations for this
including melena, poor po intake, pain, and possible benzo
withdrawal. No evidence of cardiac ischemia on EKG, troponins
flat. CXR without evidence of enlarged mediastinum.  Repeat V/Q
low probability/normal study and chest pain resolved
spontaneously.

# Melena: EGD with esophagitis, GI recommended 4 week repeat
EGD, [**Hospital1 **] ppi x 1 mo, avoid NSAIDS.  Appointment arranged for
follow up on discharge.

# Leg weakness: Has history of sciatic pain in left leg. Also
has past back injury with L4-L5 disk bulging. Sensory/strength
exam possibly concerning for L4-5 deficit. PT, supportive care.
.
# Acute renal failure: prerenal, resolved with fluids.
.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2: resumed home dose of metformin with
good control.

# Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes along with elevated CK,
ALT is at a peak relative. Combination of transaminitis with
elevated CK could be concerning for toxic or medication effect,
might be statin effect. Discontinued statin and LFTs trended
down, near normal at discharge.  Should be repeated in 4 weeks
to assure normalization.

# Hypothyroidism: normal TSH.

# PAF: Currently in NSR. Not on coumadin as outpt. On metoprolol
12.5 mg po bid.

# Homelessness/Substance abuse: psychiatry evaluated patient and
initially recommended inpatient psychiatry after medical
clearance, but subsequently felt he did not require
hospitalization.  He was arranged to go to a safe house by
social work, but refused.  He was discharged to the street with
options for homeless shelters.

# Psych: reinitiated home psych meds.

   Patient / Family Assessment:
   This note is to account for an interview that occurred on [**2149-3-4**] on
   the TSICU.
   SW met w/ pt to assess coping and substance abuse, and to provide
   support s/p trauma.  Disc'd case w/ TSICU team and reviewed chart.
   Pt is a 46yo Cauc M, currently separated from his wife, [**Name (NI) **]'d from
   OSH and adm'd to Trauma Service s/p fall down escalator at a mall.  He
   suffered a retroperitoneal hematoma and L3/L4 spinal fxs.  Per pt and
   chart, PMH includes HTN, ETOH abuse and depression.  Pt reportedly
   takes Cymbalta, Risperidone, Trazodone and Xanax for his psychiatric
   needs. Tox screen was negative upon arrival. Pt currently [**Doctor Last Name 2110**] a 2
   on a CIWA scale.
   In mtg w/ pt at beside on the TSICU, he is sitting up, wincing in pain,
   fully A&O w/ tense affect.  Mood is ""not great.""  Speech is soft and
   mildly slurred.  TP is in tact but somewhat scattered.  TC is negative,
   focused on physical discomfort and multiple psychosocial stressors.  Pt
   denies SI/HI.  Denies and does not display any symptoms of thought d/o
   at this time.  Engages reluctantly and ultimately asks to curtail
   interview ""because I have other things I need to concentrate on right
   now and I'm in pain.""
   Pt recounts situation in which he fell. He was at the mall and his shoe
   lace got caught in the escalator.  He fell down the stairs.  He elected
   to go home but his pain increased in the hours that followed and he
   called 911.
   Pt reports he and his wife are in the middle of a divorce process.  His
   description of their relationship indicates it is contentious.  He
   reports he had been staying in a hotel during their separation, but
   that it became too expensive, so he moved back in w/ her.
   In terms of pt's substance use, he endorsed to his RN that consumes
   approx 6 12oz beers per night.  With this writer, pt states he consumes
   approx 1pt of whiskey ""a few times a week.""  He reports getting a DUI
   approx 6 months ago, at which time his license was suspended.  He has
   not been able to afford renewing it.  In addition to ETOH, pt reports
   he is rx'd Percoset, which he says he takes as prescribed for back
   pain.  Pt reports he has been involved w/ AA and regularly attends two
   different meetings. He finds this helpful and declines to engage in
   discussion of other treatment options for his ETOH abuse.
   Pt gives vague report his prior mental health treatment.  He reports he
   started at [**Hospital1 3291**] Counseling approx 6 months ago for 2-3 weeks, but he
   does not recount what level of care he received.  He denies having a
   therapist at this time, but he does have a psychiatrist, the name of
   whom he does not remember.
   Pt reports he has 2 children (unk ages) who live w/ him and his wife.
   [**Name (NI) **] also has a sister, whom pt describes as ""somewhat"" supportive.  He
   otherwise describes having little social support.
   SW inquired about HCP and/or healthcare decision maker in the event
   that pt becomes unable to make his own medical decisions.  He said he
   would like his sister to make medical decisions if he becomes
   incapacitated.  RN reports pt's sister has expressed concern over pt's
   ETOH use and overall life situation at this time.
   At this time, pt denies acute reactions to trauma.  He expresses some
   anxiety re: his marital and living situations, as well as being
   unemployed.  He declines further engagement w/ SW at this time because
   of his pain level.  SW provided SW contact info and will continue to
   follow.  Plan to speak w/ pt's sister re: her concerns and her
   availability to support pt.  Relayed case info to RN and TSICU

Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o male initially transferred from OSH to the SICU.
Triple phase CT scan was performed on his abdomen.
-Segment VIII 4.0 x 3.9 x 4.0-cm heterogeneously enhancing liver
mass is
concerning for a hepatoma.
-No change in hemoperitoneum, with no evidence of active
extravasation.
-Subtle focus of arterial enhancement in segment VI, also
concerning for
malignancy.
-Tumor/ thrombus in middle hepatic vein.
-Mesenteric stranding and thick walled colon, likely from third
spacing. Varices.
He received 3 units of RBC's for the bleeding from the right
lobe of the liver. His Hct remained stable following the
transfusions.
Patients' main complaint was pain, most notably in shoulders and
upper back. He was initially given oxycodone with fair effect
and switched to dilaudid which appeared to provide better pain
relief.
Patient was seen by the GI service while in house, and an
attempt was made to obtain EGD. He was unable to tolerate
conscious sedation, and in fact became agitated with
administration of Versed. The patient will be scheduled for an
outpatient EGD and potentially for liver biopsy to assess status
of the hepatitis C and evidence of cirrhosis as this has not
been done in the past.
Patient underwent nuclear bone scan which reports:
No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastases. Degenerative
changes in the
lower lumbar spine, mid thoracic spine, right sternoclavicular
joint and right
knee.
He was also seen by Hepatology service who will follow, and if
patient wishes to pursue interferon therapy at some point, they
will become involved.
Patients case was presented at Radiologic rounds and the
decision was made to offer patient chemoembolization as this was
not felt to be resectable.
He will return to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9411**] clinic in 2 weeks and also has GI
follow-up scheduled.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33469**] is a 43 y/o M with a h/o bipolar d/o who presents
after a suicide attempt from a clonidine overdose.
.
#) Clonidine Overdose: The patient reported on presentation to
the ED that he took 60 pills of clonidine 0.1mg in a suicide
attempt; he is no longer suicidal.  The toxicology team was
consulted and recommended treating hypotension with naloxone and
use pressors as necessary.  Initial effects of clonidine
overdose can include hypertension, especially in patients who
also receive naloxone.  Later effects include hypotension,
bradycardia, CNS depression, respiratory depression and miosis.
The patient received a dose of naloxone in the ED, but needed no
further therapy once transferred to the ICU.  He was monitored
in the ICU for a day with no sign of paroxysmal hypertension or
hypotension.  He was not bradycardic and had no sign of
respiratory depression.  There were no EKG changes.  A chest
X-ray to check for aspiration was negative.  After observation
during the day, he was transferred to the medical floor for
further therapy.
.
#) Bipolar Disorder/Suicide Attempt: The patient has had
multiple hospitalizations and suicide attempts in the past, and
currently admits to being very depressed.  On admission he was
unable to articulate many details about his care or medications,
but during the first day became more alert and was able to
discuss his mood with the psychiatry team.  Given his recent
history of relapse and serious suicide attempt, it was
determined he required admission to a locked psychiatric unit.
He was placed on 1:1 observation during his stay for safety and
a section 12 was filed.  The patient signed a release for
records from his [**Hospital1 1680**] hospitalization; these records are
pending.  He was continued on Tegretol for his bipolar disorder.
.
#) Pyuria: On admission the patient was found to have signs of
infection on urinalysis.  Rectal exam revealed no clinical
evidence for prostatitis.  Antibiotics were held in the absence
of symptoms or positive cultures. Final culture was negative.

#) TMJ - chronic jaw pain; continued on ibuprofen.

#)ID - patient had a positive MRSA screen and was placed on
contact precautions.

patient's hematocrit at that time was reportedly 33%, and an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was reportedly negative (although
there was some question of some [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears that had
healed).  The patient was treated and released from
[**Hospital3 **] and was subsequently readmitted there on
[**2103-3-15**] with some similar complaints.  His hematocrit
on this readmission was 15.6.  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy
on the second admission to [**Hospital1 3494**] revealed fundal ulcer
in the stomach with a visible vessel.  This ulcer and vessel
were reportedly sclerosed and the patient was given a total
of 8 units of packed red blood cells in the hospital over a
fourteen day period.  Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy on
[**2103-3-22**] reportedly revealed an ulcer base that had
shrunk, but had remained present and with a visible vessel.
Biopsy was reportedly negative for cancer or H-pylori,
however, subsequent serology revealed that the patient was
positive for H-pylori exposure and the patient was started on
Amoxicillin, Clarithromycin, and Protonix.  A chest,
abdominal and pelvic CT had reportedly revealed a possible
malignant ulcer in the upper gastric fundus.  The patient was
subsequently discharged from [**Hospital3 **], however, he
represented one day after admission to [**Hospital1 3494**] Emergency
Department with a hematocrit of 22.  The patient was thus
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
consideration of embolization of the ulcers artery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Alcohol abuse.  The patient denies
history of cardiac, renal and liver disease.  He denies
history of diabetes.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS (PRIOR TO ADMISSION TO [**Hospital3 **]):  None.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM [**Hospital3 **] TO [**Hospital1 **]:  Protonix 40 mg q.d.,
Amoxicillin 1 gram b.i.d., Clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is from El [**Country 19118**].  He has
eleven children.  One of the patient's sons lives in the
[**Name (NI) 86**] area, although the patient does not see him often.
The patient is reportedly homeless.  The patient denies
current tobacco or other drug abuse.  The patient admits to
drinking.  He sometimes consumes up to thirty beers per day.
At the time of his transfer to [**Hospital1 188**], the patient had not had any thing to drink since the
beginning of [**2103-3-9**] reportedly.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  CBC revealed a white blood
cell count of 10.4, hematocrit of 22.2, platelets 237.  MCV
91.  Coag studies revealed an INR of 1.3, PT 13.6, PTT of
26.9.  Chem 7 revealed sodium 141, potassium 4.0, chloride
110, bicarb 24, BUN 22, creatinine 0.7, glucose 104.  Liver
function tests revealed ALT of 10, AST 19, alkaline
phosphatase 70, amylase 96, total bilirubin of 0.2, lipase of
44.  The patient's albumin was 2.9, calcium 6.0, phosphorus
5.5, and magnesium 1.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 16786**] to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit on [**2103-3-31**].
During the patient's stay in the Intensive Care Unit he was
transfused with 4 units of packed red blood cells, after
which his hematocrit rose appropriately.  On [**2103-3-31**]
the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy that
revealed a single, acute, 18 mm ulcer at the proximal stomach
body near the cardia.  A visible vessel suggested recent
bleeding.  The area was injected with epinephrine times three
and electrocautery was employed for successful hemostasis.
The patient's brief Intensive Care Unit course was barely
stable.  He did have some mild hypotension (systolic blood
pressure to the 80s and 90s, asymptomatic), which responded
to intravenous fluid boluses.  The patients hematocrit
remained fairly stable and he was transferred to the [**Company 191**]
Service on the Medicine Floor on [**2103-4-1**].  The patient
was maintained on his H-pylori treatment and his hematocrit
was monitored while on the medicine floor.  Additionally, the
patient's diet was advanced, first to clears and then to full
regular diet.  The patient tolerated this well without
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or any further gastrointestinal
bleeding.

The patient's blood pressure on the medicine floor was noted
to be mildly and transiently depressed.  The patient reported
occasional dizziness, although this eventually resolved with
advancement of his diet.  The patient was ambulating well and
did not feel or exhibit any signs or symptoms of imbalance.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Vital signs stable.  Afebrile.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed, gastric ulcer, status post
epinephrine injection and sclerotherapy on
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
2.  History of alcohol abuse.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient was discharged with
prescriptions for Amoxicillin, Biaxin and Protonix as well as
a multi vitamin.  The patient has six more days of his
H-pylori treatment to complete.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**]
in the [**Hospital 191**] Clinic on [**2103-5-11**] at 2:00 p.m. (this is the
earliest date at which a Spanish interpreter would be
available).  Additionally, the patient is to follow up with
the [**Hospital **] Clinic in approximately eight weeks for a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  The patient was given references
for outpatient alcohol rehab/detox programs, but is not
currently interested in pursuing these options.

Brief Hospital Course:
43 year old gentleman admitted to the acute care service after
being found under a bridge partially submerged in water.  Upon
admission, he was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, and
underwent radiographic imaging. He sustained multiple facial
lacerations which were sutured.  He was also found to have
bilateral rib fractures, as well as cervical and thoracic spine
injuries.  He was admitted to the trauma sicu for monitoring.
Because of the extent of his cervical and thoracic injuries, he
was evaluated by ortho-spine.  He was taken to the operating
room on HOD #1 where he underwent a T7-L1 laminectomy and
fusion.  His operative course was notable for a siginficant
blood loss of 1 liter.  In addition to this, he required packed
red blood cells to correct his blood loss.  He was transported
to the intensive care unit after the surgery still intubated and
sedated on propofol.  He was evaluated by Plastic surgery and
was found on imaging to have a left orbital wall fracture.  For
this injury, he was placed on sinus precautions and no further
intervention. The Neurology service was consulted regarding
resuming his anti-seizure medication. His depakote was
re-started per their recommendations.  He has not had any
seizure activity during his hospitalization. His post-operative
course has been stable.
He was fitted for a cervical-TLSO brace and has used this when
out of bed.  He is tolerating a regular diet and voiding without
difficulty.  His vital signs are stable and he is afebrile. He
has been evaluated by physical and occupational therapy and
recommendations made for discharge to a rehabilition facility.
He has been evaulated by psychiatry because of the nature of his
injury and his history of poly-substance abuse to ascertain if
this injury is self-inflicted. It was thought that this injury
did not represent a suicide attempt.
He is preparing for discharge with recommended follow-up with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], seizure specialist, opthamology, and ortho-spine.

CXR:

Brief Hospital Course:
46 M with history of ETOH abuse, here with ETOH withdrawal,
possible pneumonia, and chest pain.
.
# ETOH withdrawal:  He reports drinking 1 pint of vodka daily
and his last drink was the day prior to admission.  He was put
on a CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal and was monitored in the
ICU for a day before he was called out to the regular Medicine
service.  His LFTs and pancreatic enzymes were elevated on
admission and consisted with alcohol hepatitis.  This normalized
over this hospital course and patiet was not requiring any
benzodiazepenes on day of discharge.  This was likely the source
of his chest pain.
.
# ETOH abuse: He was given multivitamin, thiamine and folate.
Social work was consulted to discuss his homeless situation and
his alcoholism.
.
# Chest pain: He was ruled out by three sets of cardiac enzymes.
 His EKG showed RBBB but there was no old EKG for comparison.
He chest pain could be from costochondritis since he was tender
to the chest wall.  He was given NSAIDs and this resolved over
his hospital course.  He was monitored on telemetry without
events.
.
# Possible retrocardiac opacity on CXR:  Given his low grade
fever and cough, he was treated with levoquin x 7 days.  He
defervesced and remained stable.
.
# h/o asthma: Albuterol and atrovent inhalers
.
# Pancytopenia: Likely from alcohol.
.
# Question of diabetes: Normal blood glucose, but urine glucose
1000 and ketones 150.  He was put on QID fingersticks and
regular insulin sliding scale.
.
.
After discussion with the patient and the medical staff, all
were in agreement that Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 111538**] was a suitable candidate
for discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2143-10-30**] Mr. [**Known lastname 28331**] was taken emergently to the operating
room, where he underwent bilateral lower extremity fasciotomies
and axillo-bifemoral bypass.  He was observed for a short while
to see how he would do with revascularization; however, the
appearance of the right leg did not improve, so he was taken
back to the operating room and an above-knee amputation of the
right lower extremity was performed to remove all infarcted
tissue.  See operative reports dictated [**2143-10-30**] for further
details of the procedures.

Postoperatively Mr. [**Known lastname 28331**] was kept intubated and transferred
to the ICU.  He was started on Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and
Flagyl.  He had several repeated episodes of vtach accompanied
by hypotension requiring electrical cardioversion and lidocaine
drip.  An echocardiogram was done and showed an EF of only 10%
with significant LV dysfunction.  The lidocaine drip was
gradually weaned off, and he was transitioned to PO amiodarone.
Tube feeds were started on POD 4.

On [**2143-11-5**] Mr. [**Known lastname 28331**] was taken back to the OR for closure of
his above knee amputation.  He went back to the ICU, and was
successfully extubated on POD [**7-14**].  Psychiatry consult was
called to evaluate the patient for his history of anxiety and
depression.

On POD [**10-17**] he was transferred to the VICU.  Upon arriving there
he experienced some episodes of hematuria.  Urology consult was
called and instituted constant bladder irrigation, after which
his urine cleared.  Antibiotics were D/C'd and physical therapy
was initiated.  His left lower extremity faciotomy wounds
required several interrupted horizontal mattress sutures to
reclose them, but otherwise his wounds continued to heal well.
By [**2143-11-27**], he was strong enough to transfer independently from
bed to chair, so was discharged back to his halfway house in New
[**Location (un) **].

he was intubated after a few attempts (reportedly with a very
""anterior"" and difficult airway).  He was started on propofol
and was admitted to the medical ICU.  Of note, ED labs were
notable for serum ETOH of 641 and CT head with a ""subtle focus
of increased attenuation in the left basal ganlgia that may
represent asymmetric mineralization.""

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1352**] is a 56 year old man found down by EMS and brought
to the [**Hospital1 18**].  He was initially intubated for airway protection
and imaging of his head.  His blood alcohol level was > 600 on
admission and this was ultimately felt to be the cause of his
obtundation.  He was initially admitted to the MICU where he
received supportive care.  He was called out of the ICU on
[**Last Name (LF) 1017**], [**6-14**] to the General Medical floor for ongoing care.
He has been treated with a CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal
symptoms as well as thiamine and folate.  He did well with
conservative, supportive care.  On the day of discharge, he was
no longer tremulous, had not required diazepam for quite some
time and professed to feeling ready to leave the hospital.  He
was seen by SW (see their note) and offered additional
resources.  He was reluctant to accept any help from SW or the
medical team re: arranging f/u care in [**Location (un) 3844**].  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]
personally advised him that it appeared that he had T2DM and
should seek a PCP upon his arrival to NH for this and his other
medical needs.  He stated he understood and would do so.

significant pulmonic regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure: Patient was continued on levoquin and
multiple doses of lasix, nebs and prednisone for presumed COPD
exacerbation.  Patient continued to sat in high 80s, low 90s on
face mask.  TTE concerning for severe pulmonary hypertension.
Patient underwent right heart catheterization to evaluate for
intracardiac shunt and to evaluate pulmonary pressures.  He was
intubated without incident for the procedure for concern that he
would desat while lying prone.  During the cath the patient
dropped his blood pressure and required levophed, vasopressin
and dopamine as well as fluids for support.  Please see cath
report for full details.  Upon return to the SICU the patient
was bradycardic and went into PEA arrest.  He was coded for
about 15 minutes and given multiple doses of epinephrine and
bicarb with normal fingerstick glucose.  The code was called at

CXR ([**9-20**]): Lateral view confirms suspicion for foreign body in
the upper
esophagus. These findings were discussed with the
gastroenterology fellow,
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 6220**], at the time of the exam

CXR ([**9-21**]): There is no evidence of pneumothorax,
pneumomediastinum or pneumoperitoneum.  Cardiomediastinal
contours are normal. The lungs are clear. Foreign body
previously described in the esophagus is not clearly visualized
in this examination.

KUB ([**9-20**]): Five pieces of radiopaque foreign body identified
within the
stomach and first portion of the duodenum, likely the reportedly
swallowed
glass.

KUB ([**9-21**]): Multiple glass fragments (four pieces) are located
through the ascending and transverse colon. There is no
pneumoperitoneum or bowel obstruction or ileus.

KUB ([**9-22**]): Multiple dense foreign bodies (glass) project in the
pelvis. They are in the distal descending colon, sigmoid, and
rectum. Fecal material is in the colon. Osseous structures are
unremarkable.

KUB ([**9-23**]): PFI-Foreign bodies no longer seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 39 year old male with a PMH significant for
psychiatric illness and multiple hospitalizations for foreign
body ingestion admitted after a neck laceration and ingestion of
several pieces of broken glass.

1. Foreign body ingestion: Appears to be broken glass, as one
piece was removed by GI via EGD.  Daily KUB radiographs were
taken, which demostrated that the patient had cleared the broken
glass. During his hospitalization, while under the supervision
of a 1:1 sitter, the patient then swallowed a clip from his
hospital room and a tube of toothpaste. A repeat EGD was
performed, but GI was unable to remove any objects. The
following day, while under the supervision of a Security sitter,
he ingested two shower curtain hooks.

2 Psych: Patient has significant psychiatric illness with
multiple foreign body ingestions/suicide attempts thought to be
attention seeking behavior.  Consult-liason psychiatry was
consulted and the patient was cleared for discharge when
medically stable.  On initial attempt to discharge, the patient
stated that, ""you guys will have to scrape my body off the
[**Location (un) 2452**] line train.""  Psychiatry was re-consulted and this was
felt to be a pattern of the patient's underlying psychiatric
illness.  The patient on [**9-25**] became increasingly agitated and
actively suicidal in his hospital room. He requested to be
placed in leather 4 point restraints to prevent him from trying
to throw himself through the window. He later freed himself from
the restraints. A code purple was called, and the patient was
placed in handcuffs and required chemical sedation to maximize
his own safety.

3. Disposition: As the patient became increasingly agitated and
difficult to control, he was unsafe to remain on CC7. Psychiatry
felt that the patient was not a candidate for psychiatric
hospitalization, so he was discharged from CC7 to the [**Hospital1 18**]
Emergency Department seclusion room.

Medications on Admission:
1. Clonazepam 0.5 mg PO TID
2. Lithium 300 QAM, 600 mg QHS

Discharge Medications:
1. Clonazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a
day).
2. Lithium Carbonate 300 mg Capsule Sig: 1 tab QAM, 2 tab QHS

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary - Foreign body ingestion

Secondary
personality disorder/sociopathy with multiple foreign body
ingesitons (glass, metal objects) . Per psych no major mental
illness. Needs 1:1 sitter with patient in view at all times. No
small objects are to be left within hand reach. No utensils on
food trays.
Status post splenectomy
Hep C


Discharge Condition:
Patient was discharged to ED seclusion room in stable condition,
with leather restraints on his feet and shackles on his hands.


Discharge Instructions:
PATIENT DISCHARGED TO EMERGENCY ROOM FOR PATIENT SAFETY

1. You were admitted because you ingested broken glass. We
removed one piece of glass from your throat, and watched via
xrays the rest of the pieces pass out of your body.  You kept on

swallowing foreign bodies.

2. As you are becoming increasingly agitated, you are being
discharged to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department seclusion area.

Followup Instructions:

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the hospital and on HD#1 appeared
progressively more tremulous and was c/o auditory and tactile
hallucinations.  Pt. was presumed to be in DT's [**2-2**] his chronic
ETOH history and he was transferred to the MICU for close
monitoring.  Pt received Valium via a CIWA scale protocol q
2hours in the unit and he did not seize.  On HD#3 Pt's vitals
were stable enough to transfer out to the floor where his vitals
remained stable on Valium CIWA Scale that was weened down to q 6
hours by HD# 6.
.
Throughout hospitalization patient had elevated LFT's, depressed
coags and pancytopenia.  These numbers were thought to be
related to the patient's liver disease and poor nutritional
status.  Further work-up was not performed as patient left AMA.
.
Pt was found to have MSSA bacteremia from his ED blood cx x 2.
Due to his PCN allergy he was started on Vancomycin and
underwent PICC placement on HD #4.  The source of the patient's
bacteremia was never identified as he had a negative torso CT,
negative CXR, negative U/A and Cx, negative TTE as well as
aspiration of anterior leg fluctuance which revealed no pus.  Pt
apparently had a PICC line at OSH prior to coming here and that
IV is a possible source of his bacteremia.  He was slated to
continue his PICC line for either a 2 week or 6 week total
course of Vancomycin.  However, on HD#6 patient demande to leave
AMA, citing personal reasons.  He was made aware of the risk of
death from his untreated bacteremia and expressed understanding
of these risks.  Pt. remained adamant about leaving, and thus
his PICC line was removed and he was allowed to leave.  He was
strongly encouraged to return to the hospital as soon as
possible to continue his antibiotic course.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 37 year-old male with a history of alcoholism with
many admissions for intoxication, Hep B+C, polysubstance abuse,
and depression, who presents with intoxication. Pt reports that
he drank 1 liter of listerine today as well as a fifth of vodka
and then blackout. He was brought to the ED intoxicated but has
no recollection of how he got to the hospital. He complains of
pain at his left knee, but does not recall injuring it, and also
complains of chronic abdominal tenderness (but only when someone
presses on it). Denies nausea or vomiting.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.7, BP 123/87, HR 110, RR 16,
99% on RA. His BAL was 456. Serum tox was also positive for
benzos. Urine tox was negative. The plan was initially to
observe the patient overnight in the ED until he became sober.
However, around 7:30pm, the attending found the patient
tremulous, with HR in the 120-130s and complaining of withdrawal
symptoms. He was also having visual hallucinations of mice
running over his legs. Exam was only notable for some blood on
his pants over his left knee and a bump on his L forehead. Neuro
exam was non-focal. He remainted tachycardic with HR as high as
140s. He received a total of 15mg PO valium, 15mg IV valium, and
1mg IV ativan. Banana bag was started but PIV was not
functioning well. Admitted to the ICU for further monitoring.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is very anxious. He is no
longer experiencing visual hallucinations but reports that he is
delirious and does not know what is going on. He is adamant that
he is going to stop drinking this time and wants to go to a
detox facility-- apparently his best friend died one week ago
from drinking listerine.
.
ROS: He has been having frontal headaches for the past month
since being hit by an SUV one month ago. Has also had R-sided
chest pain at the site of impact from this MVC for the past
month. Has broken his nose several times and has difficulty
breathing from that. He also notes seeing spots in the periphery
of his vision recently. He complains of gait instability when
sober (less so when intoxicated) and also peripheral neuropathy
in his arms and legs. The patient denies any fevers, chills,
weight change, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, melena, hematochezia, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency,

Brief Hospital Course:
37 year-old male with a history of alcoholism with multiple
admissions for detox and history of DTs/withdrawal seizures who
presents with intoxication followed by withdrawal. He received
30 mg Valium in the emergency room and was placed on a q1h CIWA
in the ICU. This was transitioned to a standing valium order per
his protocol on arrival to the floor. Social work was consulted.
MVI/thiamine/folate were given. He was monitored on telemetry.
.
His lipase and transaminases were elevated during his admission,
consistent with his chronic hepatitis C, in addition to
alcoholic hepatitis. He had abdominal pain which was the same as
on prior admissions and was likely related to alcoholic
pancreatitis or gastritis, but was resolved on discharge. This
improved and he was tolerating pos.
.
He noted knee pain as well, and an x-ray was performed which did
not show a fracture.
.
He was started on Klonopin for anxiety, similar to previous
outpatient dosing. He had a PPD placed, which was positive at
>20 mm, and a CXR was performed which was negative.

Unfortunately, on the day of anticipated discharge to [**Hospital1 **]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2093**] is a 62 year old female with history of bipolar d/o
and multiple suicide attempts, DM, HCV, who was found outside of
her home drooling, diaphoretic, and non-verbal. She was taken by
EMS to [**Hospital3 1280**]. Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 **] ED, her vitals
were BP 132/67, HR 78, T 98.6, RR 16, 96% on RA. She independent
at baseline and last spoke with her son the day before and
denied any mood disturbances. At [**Hospital1 **], she had a negative
head CT, c-spine CT, CXR, LP, and tox screen at OSH. She was
found to be hyperglycemic to 450 and so was given 10 units of
insulin. She was seen by neurology who felt she needed a higher
level of neurology care. They raised concern for non-convulsive
status. At [**Hospital1 **], she was given a banana bag, 10 units SQ of
regular insulin for hyperglycemia to 450, and dilantin 1 g IV
given the concern for non-convulsive status.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.9, HR 72, BP 122/60, RR 30,
99% on 4L NC. In triage, she was observed to be having episodes
of apnea. She was briefly hypotensive to 72/40 and responded to
2L IVF. A right femoral line was placed. She subsequently
developed hypotension to 81/42 and so levophed was started at
0.1 mg/kg/hr. She had a head CT, CT c-spine, and CXR repeated
here which were negative. She was given vancomycin, zosyn, and
ceftriaxone. Neuro consult was called, but they were unable to
evaluate the patient in the ED. She was given calcium and
glucagon in the case of potential calcium channel blocker
overdose.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient is diaphoretic and
unresponsive. She is non-verbal and does not follow commands.

CT HEAD
HISTORY: 62-year-old woman with altered mental status.

FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of
midline structures, or edema. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
is normally
preserved. The ventricles and cerebral sulci are prominent,
likely reflecting
age-related involutional change. Note is made of cavum septum
pellucidum et
vergae. A small, 3 mm lipoma is located posterior to the
splenium of the
corpus callosum.

Mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus is minimal. The
visualized
paranasal sinuses are otherwise normally aerated. The mastoid
air cells are
clear. Vascular calcifications involve the internal carotid
arteries
bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW:

There is a slightly dense focus in the left side of pons, (se 2
and 3, im 9)
which is liekly artifactual on the thin section reformations
obtained.
Attention can be paid on follow up studies.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2093**] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL,
bipolar disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from
medication overdoses who is admitted with altered mental status.

.
1. Altered mental status. Patient presented with altered menal
status. CT head and c-spine were unremarakable. UA and CXR
negative. Patient's infectious workup was negative though she
did have a left shift on her differential and an elevated
lactate. The differential for her altered mental status included
seizure/post-ictal state, occult infection, unknown ingestion.
Her osmolar gap was 3 and Stox/Utox were negative, but patient
has history of multiple suicide attempts in the past with
ingestions of prescribed meds. Muscular rigidity, temperature
and history of medication overdoses raises the question of
serotonin syndrome.  A neuro consult was called and they
recommended EEG (negative for seizure), MRI (negative for
intracranial process/mass), LP (negative), TSH (wnl).  Dilantin
was continued. They then recommended 24hr EEG which showed no
evidence of seizure and dilantin was stopped. Outside hospital
lamictal levels were elevated at 35.  Her mental status grdually
improved.  On speaking with her son, she said that she had
""taken a lot of pills"" before she came in.  Psychiatry was
consulted for suicide attempt, and recommended prn haldol for
agitation, 1:1 sitter, and inpatient psychiatric admission on
discharge.
.
2. Hypotension. Differential for hypotension was hypovolemic
versus septic. She had no positive culture data as yet and no
localizing symptoms though patients mental status make history
limited. Patient's presentation of being found down raises the
possibility of hypovolemia from poor PO intake. She was treated
with prn IVF boluses, empiric antibiotics with
vanco/ceftriaxone, kept on levophed prn. Her home lisinopril was
initially held then restarted on discharge.
.
3. Elevated lactate. Raised the possibility of an infection, but
infectious workup was negative. Also, could be secondary to
seizure activity but negative EEG. Trended and found to resolve
on ICU day 1.
.
4. Hyperglycemia. Patient presented with hyperglycemia to 450
which has responded to insulin. No evidence of DKA. She was kept
on an HISS, we followed fingersticks, and held her home actos,
glyburide, and metformin. All DM meds were restarted upon
discharge.
.
5. Bipolar disorder. Patient has a history of bipolar disorder,
on disability. Multiple prior overdoses with medications.
.
6. Hepatitis C. Patient with ALT of 142, AST 83, with normal
albumin. INR normal at OSH. Per OSH report, patient was recently
diagnosed in [**12-11**]. No evidcence of cirrhosis by labs or on exam.
 LFTs trended down. Likely from hep C. She needs follow up with
her PCP for this, then referral to GI from there.
.
7. Hyperlipidemia.  Held simvastatin given elevated LFTs and
inability to take POs. This should be held until f/u with PCP.
.
8. ? artifact on CT. CT head needs repeat as o/p to follow up
likely artifact. See read above.
.
Code: DNR/DNI, paperwork in the chart

IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 29 yo M with h/o of bipolar disorder, anxiety, and
depression now admitted for UGIB.
.
# UGIB: Patient reported vomitting blood prior to admission. NG
lavage in the ED showed red/pink blood that GI and the ICU team
thought was due to NG trauma or other benign process. The
patient remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrits
throughout his stay in the ED and the ICU. Furthermore, he had
no further episodes of hemetemisis during admission. He was
initially started on a protonix gtt in the ED which was changed
to protonix IV BID while in house. GI was consulted and felt
that the patient was currently stabile and no urgent EGD was
indicated at this time. However, nonurgent endoscopy is
indicated and out-patient coordination for this procedure should
be arranged with the patient and his out-patient care providers.
Of course, the patient should avoid NSAIDS and ETOH and was
advised to do so until an out-patient EGD can be performed.
.
# Psych issues with SI/HI: He presented with intermittent
agitation and symptoms of depression. The patient was evaluated
by psychiatry who felt it is unclear if he has underlying
primary psychiatric or mood disorder, but certainly meets
criteria for antisocial personality disorder. While patient was
hospitalized, he was given lyrica, carbamazepime, ziprasidone,
Chlorpromazine x 1, and ativan x 1. He was also treated with
zyprexa 10 mg IM twice for agitation and aggressive behavior,
including threatening comments and one episode in which he
physically struck a staff member. During his hospitalization he
had a 1:1 sitter and security. Patient did not require
restraints. He did intermittently endorse SI and HI, and
Psychiatry felt it appropriate that he return to [**Hospital1 1680**] House
for on-going, in-patient psychiatric care.
.
# EtoH abuse: Patient's last drink was more than 5 days prior to
admission and therefore it was determined that CIWA was not
indicated at this time. Patient was given folate, thiamine, MVI.

.
# Asthma/bronchitis: Patient was continued on flovent,
ipratropium, albuterol nebs and montelukast. His bactrim was
discontinued.
.
# Back/leg pain: Patient was continued on methocarbamol and
lyrica. His gabapentin was stopped.
.
transitional issues:
- patient will need outpatient endoscopy
- patient's psychiatric medications may need further adjustments

- if/when he is re-hospitalized, staff should be very careful
given his history of violent behavior, including physically
striking a staff member during this hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted to the hospital for episodes of blood in
vomit. While in the hospital we monitored your blood pressure
and levels of red blood cells, and found that you did not have a
significant bleed by the time of discharge. You will likely
require an upper endoscopy in the future on a non-emergent
basis.

Please make the following changes to your medications:

Tachycardia, hypotension, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac catheterization
2. Colonoscopy
3. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
4. PICC LINE PLACEMENT

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 37y/o African American female with a history of Crohn's
Disease s/p 2 partial small bowel resections and a history of
CHF with a documented EF of 30% who presented from the stress
test lab with the complaint of resting tachycardia to 180 and
hypotension at SBP 80.  The patient had been experiencing
abdominal pain with frequent stools (10-12 per day), with pain
relieved by stooling.  Stools were non-bloody, loose, lots of
mucus.  Pt stated that these symptoms were similar to what she
gets when she has a Crohn's flare.  Her last flare was roughly a
month ago, resulting in a 5 day hospitalization.  She has tried
Remicade in the past, but it did not work very well for her.
She has noted a decrease in PO intake along with her frequent
stooling, and feels thirsty all the time.  She stated that she
gets dizzy when she stands up quickly.  She also noted that she
has had some chest pain in the past weeks to months.  Her chest
pain was worse with exertion, was accompanied by SOB, and
improved with rest.  The chest pain was non-radiating.  This CP
was the reason for her stress test on the day of admission.
Unfortunately, the test was not able to be performed due to her
hemodynamic instability.  She has not experienced F/C.  She
noted nausea/vomiting if she ate a large meal.  She denied
dysuria/hematuria.  She noted rectal and abdominal pain as
above, relieved by stooling.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT  [**2204-9-2**] 2:25 PM

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT

Reason: dvt Vs cellulitis

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
37 year old woman with hypotension/tachycardia, cardiomyopathy
s/p PICC with increasing RUE edema and pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
dvt Vs cellulitis
INDICATION: 37-year-old woman with increasing right upper
extremity edema.

COMPARISON: [**2204-8-28**], right upper extremity ultrasound.

FINDINGS: As previously identified, there is a large thrombus
extending from the axillary vein into the brachial vein and the
subclavian. There has been no significant change in the short
interval.

RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: 2D, color and Doppler waveform
imaging was obtained of the right common femoral, superficial
femoral and popliteal veins. Normal compressibility, waveforms
and augmentation was demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus
identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis.

Mucosal biopsies, two:



A.  Ileum:

Chronic active inflammation with ulceration and granulation
tissue.  See note.

B.  Left colon:

Chronic active inflammation with ulceration and granulation
tissue.

Note:  No granulomas, viral inclusions, or dysplasia seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Tachycardia/hypotension/CHF:  Initial EKGs revealed sinus
tachycardia up to 160s. Pt was initially given limited fluids in
light of recent EF of 30%. Given her acute decline in EF,
cardiology was consulted and considered catheterization
necessary to r/o ischemia as a cause of this new cardiomyopathy.
Catheterization was performed on [**2204-8-24**] without complications.
On cath she was noted to have: No angiographic evidence of
coronary artery disease.  Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
 Normal left and right sided filling pressures.  LVEF was 50%
with mild apical hypokinesis. Workup for other causes of sinus
tachycardia was continued, revealing negative cosyntropin test
for adrenal insufficiency, negative urine catecholamines for
pheochromocytoma. Pt did not present with symptoms c/w sepsis or
anaphylaxis. Lack of pulmonary complaints or findings made PE or
tension PTX unlikely. Lack of pericardial rub, JVD, or pleuritic
CP made tamponade less likely.  Pt was noted to have a HCT drop
the day after her cardiac catheterization ([**8-25**]).  No source of
bleeding was identified, but due to the patient's tenuous
hemodynamic status she was transferred to the CCU for further
management.  A CT scan showed signs of volume overload, but no
evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.  A vascular examination of
the RLE catheterization site showed no evidence of hematoma from
the cath.  Essentially, no source was identified for the
hematocrit drop, and following transfusion the patient
maintained a stable Hct.  Due to continuing fevers and her
Crohn's disease, she was started on Meropenem to cover
translocation of gut bacteria.  She continued to have periods of
hypotension and tachycardia, but this was not fundamentally
different from her presenting symptoms.  She was transferred
back to the primary medical team on [**8-28**]. From that point
onwards, patient's tachycrdia improved and eventually abated as
her Crohn's disease was adressed and treated. No further acute
cardiac events occurred and patient remained stable on
telemetry.
.
2.  Crohn's Disease:  On [**8-29**] pt underwent colonoscopy & EGD to
evaluate the status of her Crohn's disease. This revealed
friability, ulceration, erythema, & congestion in the descending
colon, sigmoid colon, & terminal ileum compatible with Crohn's.
There was also friability & erythema in the proximal anal canal.
EGD showed a normal upper GI tract through D3. Per GI
recommendations, pt was started on IV solumedrol for Crohn's
flare and TPN for malnourished state. Diet was advanced as
tolerated to a low-residue, high protein, lactose-restricted
diet.  The patient was started on Asacol and Cipro/Flagyl in
light of the flare. Patient was also changed to Prednisone by
time of discharge. The patient was discharged to acute
rehabilitation with instructions to follow up in Dr.[**Name (NI) 110985**]
clinic as directed.  The patient was to receive 4 weeks of TPN
at rehab. Patient also received intermittent Blood transfusions
in setting of active crohn's disease and responded
appropriately. Her baseline HCT ranged 28-31. Patient contineud
to have brown guiac positve stool.
.
3. Anemia: Vitamin B12, folate, and iron were administered to
compensate for possible vitamin deficiency anemia due to Crohn's
malabsorption, decreased PO intake, and profuse diarrhea.
Several transfusions of packed RBCs were administered during
hospital course for acute drops in Hct. Iron studies showed low
serum TRF, low TIBC, and high ferritin consistent with anemia of
chronic disease. Protein-calorie malnutrition likely also
contributed to anemia. Erythropoietin was restarted as patient
had been taking this as outpatient.
.
4. RUE DVT: The patient was found to have a RUE DVT that was
likely caused by insertion of a PICC line in the venous anatomy
of the RUE.  Vascular Surgery was consulted on the case.  It was
decided to anticoagulate the patient for a period of [**4-8**] months,
first with heparin, then transitioned onto Coumadin.  Because of
the known inciting incident for the DVT, it can be assumed that
the patient does not have a hypercoaguable state outside of her
Crohn's Disease itself. Patient also had evidence of erythema of
her RUE-felt to be consistent with cellulutis, and given her
immunocompromised state, IV Vancomycin was started to complete a
14 day course. By time of discharge, patient's erythema had
abated. A repeat UE US revealed no progression of DVT.
.
5.  Bilateral knee pain/proximal weakness:  Shortly before
admission, the patient had recently started seeing a
rheumatologist for her musculoskeletal complaints.  Per rheum,
her knee pain is likely [**3-7**] history of obesity with degenerative
changes.  Her proximal muscle weakness may be caused by
steroids, a Crohn's myopathy, or a paraneoplastic syndrome.  Per
the rheumatologist, this is most likely [**3-7**] steroid myopathy.
While a workup for this knee pain was not pursued during this
hospitalization, the patient should have bilateral weight
bearing knee films obtained as an outpatient to further evaluate
for degenerative joint disease.
.
6.  New breast mass: Pt complains of a new breast mass in the L
axilla.  This mass was to be evaluated by mammogram as an
outpatient. Pt has had a roughly 150lb weight loss over the past
year and a half, [**Month/Day (2) 2771**] to Crohn's. While a workup for this
breast mass was not pursued during this hospitalization, the
patient should have a mammogram as an outpatient to evaluate the
possible breast mass.
.
7. Schizoaffective disorder: The pt's outpatient medications
were continued. Follow up as outpatient with psychiatrist is
recommended to monitor this condition.
.
8. Edema: Patient showed evidence of total body fluid overload
during her hospitalization, felt secondary to hypoalbumenia,
malnutrition, large volume infusion. The patient received
intermittent doses of lasix with good effect.
.
9. CRI: Cr remained at baseline of 1.1-1.5.
.
10. PPx: Heparin ggt, Coumadin, PRN Bowel Regimen

Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old man with a longstanding history of alcoholism and
multiple recent admissions for alcohol withdrawal who presents
requesting alcohol detox after he was found to be intoxicated.

# EtOH withdrawal - pt came to ED intoxicated (EtOH = 221) and
was admitted to medicine floor. Pt had hallucinations in the ED
but no seizures throughout admission.  Pt was treated with IV
diazepam and ondansetron because of his poor po tolerance. His
initial requirement was 20mg IV q2h, but over the next 48 hours
this was tapered to oral diazepam 10mg q2h and finally to oral
diazepam 5mg q3h upon discharge.  This course has been similar
to his previous admissions.  He received two banana bags on Day
1, but was transitioned to po thiamine and folate on Day 2.  He
was discharged with a regimen of thiamine, folate, and
multivitamin with plans to follow up with his PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5717**] in
2 weeks.  He was encouraged to abstain from alcohol and attend
AA meetings.

# Social concerns - pt expressed anxiety and sadness over his
social situation during the admission.  Pt has been living in
public housing and has been illegally housing a ""lady friend""
who had invited over guests who were using illicit drugs.  He
stated that police had been called and that he was now going to
be evicted.  SW was called during admission and contact was made
with the patient's outpatient psychologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 26079**].  Per his
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9278**] issues have been ongoing and are being addressed by
outside social workers and should not hold up his discharge.
The patient was encouraged to contact his social worker ([**Name (NI) 76209**]
[**Name (NI) 14323**]) upon discharge to help him sort out his social
situation.

# HTN - patient was continued on his home HTN medication.  His
BP was initially elevated but improved with diazepam and
cessation of withdrawal.

Medications on Admission:
- omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY
- lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide 10-12.5 mg One Tablet PO DAILY

History of Present Illness:

81 yo who mostly gets care at [**Hospital1 3278**], discharged from [**Hospital1 3278**] to
[**Last Name (un) **] yesterday. This morning was found down by NH with
glucose 25. He has a
history of diabetes and is on 10mg glipizide, and insulin. He
received 2 amps of glucagon before arrival to [**Hospital1 **]. Vitals on
arrival 97 66 178/83 16 98%. BS maintained in the 20s. An amp of
glucose was given which brought up his sugar to 78 and then 107.
1.5 hours later, BS was 50. He was placed on D5 gtt and given SC
octreotide for possible sufonyl urea toxicity. Given his altered
mental status, neurology was called to evaluate and felt that
stoke unlikely with exam and INR 4.5. His troponin was elevated
and cardiology was called to review ECG which they did not feel
was concerning. On transfer, vitals were 88 112/57 24 100 2L NC.

.
Regarding his recent medical history, he has bounced back and
forth between [**Hospital1 **] and rehab. His mental status appears to be
at recent baseline. According to nursing staff at [**Last Name (un) **], he
has no close family. He is dependent on others for all
activities of daily living including feeding. He has very
minimal speech output.

Imaging:
CT scan head [**2181-4-7**]:
1. No acute intracranial process. Chronic involutional changes.
2. Moderate paranasal sinus disease.
.
CXR [**2181-4-7**]: Lung volumes are slightly low with crowding of the
bronchovasculature in the lower lungs, especially right
perihilar. A
developing pneumonia in the RML is difficult to exclude. No
pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present. The cardiac
silhouette is top normal in size. Hilar and mediastinal contours
appear normal.

LEUS:
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus seen within the right
popliteal vein
consistent with the known DVT. No additional thrombus seen in
the deep veins
of both legs. Note is made that the calf veins could not be
imaged.

EEG [**4-9**]:
Prelminary report shows diffuse slowing consistent with a
metabolic encephalopathy, no spikes concerning for epileptiform
activity.

CT Chest and Abdomen [**4-9**]:
Final Report
EXAMINATION: CT of the torso with intravenous and oral contrast.


INDICATION: 81-year-old male with significant decline in mental
status over
the last two months with a negative head CT. Known history of
COPD. Found to
have a right breast chest wall mass. Hypoalbuminemia and
coagulopathy.

COMPARISONS: Chest radiograph [**2181-4-9**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT examination was performed from the
upper abdomen.
Subsequently, 130 cc of intravenous contrast was administered
and axial MDCT
was performed from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis.
Subsequently,
three-minute delays were obtained through the upper abdomen. No
oral contrast
was administered. Sagittal and coronal reformats were generated
and reviewed.

FINDINGS:

CT OF THE CHEST: Within the left thyroid gland, a 17-mm
hypoattenuating
lesion is seen. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and
opacification.
Mild calcific atherosclerosis of the arch. Central pulmonary
arteries are
patent. The heart is normal in size. No pericardial effusion.
Mild
atherosclerosis of the coronary artery. No significant
mediastinal or hilar
adenopathy. Subcentimeter subcarinal, right hilar, paratracheal
nodes are
seen.

On lung windows, there are small scattered pulmonary blebs. Mild
biapical
scarring. Respiratory motion precludes evaluation of fine
pulmonary nodules.
No lung parenchymal masses, effusions, or pneumothorax. Patchy
opacities at
the right lung base and linear opacities at the left lung base
likely
represent atelectasis or scar. The central airway is patent.

Subcentimeter axillary lymph nodes are seen bilaterally. No
discrete right
breast or right chest wall mass is seen. There is
induration/hazy stranding
of the subcutaneous fat involving the right lateral and right
flank. This
appears slightly asymmetric. No abnormal enhancement in this
region.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Tiny hypodensities in segment VI of the liver
(series 3,
image 60), most likely a cyst but too small to further
characterize. Liver
otherwise enhances normally without intrahepatic or extrahepatic
biliary
ductal dilatation. Portal and hepatic veins are patent. The
gallbladder
contains small stones in the dependent aspect. No
pericholecystic fluid or
adjacent inflammatory changes. Pancreas is mildly atrophic. No
peripancreatic
inflammatory changes or main pancreatic ductal dilatation. The
spleen is
normal in size and opacification. The adrenal glands are
unremarkable
bilaterally. The kidneys appear symmetric with preserved
corticomedullary
differentiation. No hydronephrosis, hydroureter, or
ureterolithiasis. No
perinephric fluid collections. Nonspecific bilateral perinephric
stranding.
There is no significant retroperitoneal adenopathy. The
abdominal aorta is
normal in caliber and opacification. Mild calcific
atherosclerosis of the
infrarenal aorta. Branch vessels normally opacify.

Unopacified bowel loops are collapsed but unremarkable in
caliber. No
significant mesenteric edema, mesenteric lymph nodes, abnormal
fluid
collections, or free air. Extensive right and left colonic
diverticulosis
without evidence for diverticulitis. Normal air-filled appendix
in the right
lower quadrant.

There is diastasis of the rectus abdominis in the periumbilical
region with a
defect measuring up to 3.3 cm transversely. There is omental fat
in the
defect. Non-obstructive transverse colon and nonobstructive
small bowel loops
are also seen in this region.

CT OF THE PELVIS: Decompressed urinary bladder with foley,
contains
nondependent air likely related to instrumentation. Prostate,
seminal
vesicles appear unremarkable. Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis
without
diverticulitis. No free fluid in the pelvis. No significant
pelvic or
inguinal adenopathy by size criteria. Multiple bilateral
subcentimeter
inguinal lymph nodes are seen, none appearing pathologically
enlarged. One
lymph node is seen within the right inguinal canal fat.

Bones: No destructive osseous lesions. Multilevel degenerative
changes of the
visualized spine. Mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 in relation
to S1.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute process within the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
2. Mild subcutaneous fat stranding overlying the right lateral
chest and
right flank, without associated mass or abnormal enhancement.
3. Colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
4. Rectus diastasis at the level of the umbilicus with omental
fat and
nonobstructed bowel loops in and near the defect.
5. Cholelithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
81M with multiple recent admits for altered mental status and
failure to thrive presents from nursing home with hypoglycemia
and somnolence, found to be delirious likely due to multiple
comorbidities. The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 3278**] Medical
Center for further care since most of his previous care and his
PCP have been centered there.

# Hypoglycemia
Likely [**1-17**] receiving oral hypoglycemics at NH/[**Hospital3 537**]
while not taking POs. It is unclear why the patient stopped
taking POs. Resolved with D5 drip in the MICU, then managed on
wards with D5 1/2NS, then after initiation of [**Name (NI) 32813**] pt required
Humalog sliding scale.

# Altered mental status
Per the pt's PCP and best friend [**Name (NI) **] the pt's mental status
and ability to care for himself has declined precipitously over
the last 6 months.  This most recent exacerbation was triggered
by hypoglycemia, however he remained obtunded even with
correction of his glucose.  In the MICU, the pt was intially
obtunded and was seen by Neurology consult team. Head CT was
negative. EEG performed, no evidence of seizure per conversation
with Neuro consult staff but the report will not be finalized
until next week. On wards day 2 after receiving [**Name (NI) 32813**], hydration,
supportive care, and correction of metabolic derangements the
patient began to wake up, was able to interact with staff,
though still lethargic.  He was arousable to voice and oriented
to name and [**Location (un) 86**].  Will require further workup into what has
caused his recent decline in functional status. TSH, B12,
folate, UA were within normal limits. Recommend checking RPR if
not done recently.

# Asthma with acute exacerbation:
Pt known asthmatic, had 2 episodes of respiratory distress in
the first 24 hours after transfer from MICU with significant
wheeze, 02 sat maintained throughout, blood gas showed PC02 in
mid 30's. Symptoms resolved with Alb/Ipra nebs and IV
methylprednisolone. On day of transfer to [**Hospital1 3278**] the pt was
breathing comfortably sat'ing 100% on 2LNC.

# R breast/chest wall  mass
Noticed on intial exam, firm, irregular, ~6cm mass along R chest
wall with superficial ulceration. CT preliminary read showing
only subcutaneous fat stranding with no definitive mass. Due to
pt's poor MS and inability to consent for a biopsy, management
of this problem was deferred.
- He will require biopsy of this mass for diagnosis.

# Coagulopathy
INR elevated to 6.5 on admission, likely from vit K deficiency
combined with coumadin use. Resolved with Vit K administration.
The pt was then started on Lovenox for DVT.

# DVT
- diagnosed at [**Hospital1 3278**] on [**4-6**].
- Also seen on our LEUS [**4-9**]
- Pt not a good candidate for coumadin given poor PO's and
mental status, therefore he was treated with [**Hospital1 **] lovenox

# Troponin Elevation
Concerning for NSTEMI, but pt without MB elevation or EKG
changes.  Cardiology saw the pt in the ED and were not
concerned, thought to be demand ischemia from prolonged
hypoglycemia.  Due to lack of EKG changes and significant MB
fraction, the likelihood of an acute infarction was thought to
be very low.  Pt was hemodynamically stable throughout hospital
stay, given a daily aspirin

# Severe malnutrition
Albumin 1.6 on admission, other laboratory abnormalities like
elev CK, INR (on coumadin) can be partially explained by
starvation.  Pt was initially given a banana bag (containing
thiamine) on the wards, then eventually transitioned to premixed
standard [**Hospital1 32813**].  Once MS improved, the patient was cleared by the
nursing staff for a puree diet, of which he tolerated well with
no aspiration. The patient will likely need supplemental
nutrition until he can receive official calorie counts and he
can maintain adequate mental status to eat on a consistent basis

# Anemia
- Brought in with Hct 21 in MICU
- Received 2U of PRBC's with adequate response
- No signs of obvious bleeding on exam, Hct remained stable
throughout remainder of hospital stay
- No evidence of hemolysis on lab evaluation
- Is likely due to his multiple nutritional deficiences but a
thorough workup had not been performed at the time of transfer
to [**Hospital1 3278**]

# Sacral and Scrotal ulcers
- Sacral stage 3, roughly 8x8 cm with no active exudate
- Scrotal stage 2, multiple linear tears
- Likely from previous episodes where he was found in his
wheelchair for multiple days at a time sitting in his own urine
and stool
- Wound care consult obtained, supportive creams and dressings,
needs improved nutritional status

# CKD stage 3
- cr 1.0 during his admission

# Social issues: Patient currently unable to make medical
decisions. Listed HCP is friend [**Last Name (un) **] however [**Name (NI) **]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 88980**]) has declined role this admission (see SH above).
Patient has no family. Spoke to oncall Legal - able to do
procedures that are considered medically urgent/emergent.
Patient transfused 2 units of blood due to demand ischemia (note
documented in metavision).

TRANSITIONS OF CARE: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital 3278**]
Medical Center for further care since all of his previous care
and his PCP are there for ongoing management of his severe
malnutrition, asthma exacerbation, acute on chronic
encephalopathy, wound care, and chest wall mass.  The patient
and his proxy, [**Name (NI) **], agreed with this transfer.

Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of your
poor mental status and very low blood sugars.  We were able to
bring your blood sugar back up, and to give you some nutrition
through the IV and you eventually started to feel better.
Although these two problems were a little better with our
treatments, you still require a lot of medical attention.  Due
to this, we decided it would be best to transfer you to [**Hospital 3278**]

Leg pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L 2nd and 3rd toe debridement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 44065**] is a 60 year-old man with a history of chronic lower
extremity venous stasis complicated by chronic cellulitis,
cerebral palsy, atrial flutter s/p recent cardioversion,
presenting with cellulitis. He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**10-24**] - [**10-28**] with toe cellulitis. He was treated with
antibiotics and discharge [**10-28**] to [**Hospital3 **] for skilled
wound care. On [**11-6**] he was discharged to home. Since then, he
has had increasing leg erythema, pain, and weeping. He denies
fevers, chills. He also denies palpitations or light-headedness.
He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2392**] [**11-12**] who noted worsening leg appearance, but
the patient refused hospitalization for IV antibiotics. His home
nurse has also been urging him to go to the hospital. Finally,
because the pain was worsening yesterday, he presented to the
ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.6, HR 94, BP 116/88, RR 16, O2
100% RA. The impression was lower extremity cellulitis. He was
given a dose of vancomycin 1g and morphine 6 mg with plans to
admit to medicine. However, overnight he was persistently tachy
to 120s, briefly hypotensive with systolic to the 70s, and did
not receive fluids. In the morning he was given a total of 4 L
NS , and antibiotics were broadened to include
piperacillin-tazobactam. HR fell to 90s-110s (sinus, with ST
depressions thought to be rate-related). Blood pressure rose to
96/60.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient complains of ongoing leg
pain. He denies chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath.
He also denies nausea, vomitting, chills. Review of systems
otherwise negative

Brief Hospital Course:
A 60 year-old man with a history of chronic venous stasis
complicated by chronic lower extremity cellulitis, cerebral
palsy, atrial flutter, currently admitted for cellulitis.
.
#. Cellulitis: He had impressive lower extremity erythema and
sloughing of skin. Although it is difficult to know what his
legs look like chronically, prior notes document mostly just
woody induration without significant erythema. The sloughing and
necrotic-appearing areas also seem to be new. The only bacteria
that has been isolated previously was MRSA from a wound. Blood
pressures were on the low end of what they have been previously
and he persisted with sinus tachycardia depite many fluid
boluses.  Boluses were continued in the MICU.  He was given
vancomycin and Zosyn, with dramatic improvement in the lower
extremity erythema over the first day.  He was given morphine IV
for pain prior to wound care; oxycontin was started for
long-acting control and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.  Blood
cultures were negative. Wound culture grew MRSA. Zosyn was
discontinued and Vancomycin was continued to complete a 14-day
course. Wound care recommendations were followed and dressings
were changed each day. Legs were kept elevated. The erythema
resolved though on discharge, there was still a moderate degree
of skin breakdown. On the days prior to discharge the posterior
surfaces of his calves developed significant bleeding from wound
beds. His hematocrit remained stable. Vascular was consulted and
they were unable to identify any actively bleeding vessels. His
dressings are to be changed per vascular/wound care
reccomendations.
.
# ? DM: FS 422 on admission with history ""borderline"" diabetes
(HgA1c 6.3% in 08/[**2138**]). BG may be elevated in the setting of
stress currently.  He was given humalog insulin sliding scale.
Blood sugars improved and SSI was discontinued.
.
#. Atrial Flutter: Pt with history of a-flutter but had
cardioversion done in late [**2138-8-3**] and is on amiodarone.
Currently EKGs all appear to be sinus.  Amiodarone and
anticoagulation were continued. Patient remained in NSR.
.
#. Cerebral palsy: Patient increasingly unable to perform ADLs.
Baclofen was continued.  He  will likely need arrangements for
more home services vs long-term care facility prior to
discharge.
.
#. Hypothyroidism:  TSH was 11.  Levothyroxine 75 mcg daily was
continued.
.
#. History of Pulmonary Embolism:  Anticoagulation was initially
held due to high INR in the setting of antibiotics. Coumadin was
restarted on the floor. On day of discharge his INR was 1.7. He
shoudl have his INR followed closely as an outpatient.
.
# ? CHF: Patient with recent clinical and echo diagnosis of
R-sided CHF, but that was in the setting of acute pulmonary
embolism. There are also mentions in prior notes of diastolic
heart failure, although this is not evidenced on his echos. He
is on a heart failure regimen at home.  Torsemide,
spironolactone, and metoprolol were initially held in the
setting of borderline blood pressures. Metoprolol was restarted
this AM prior to transfer to the floor. Spironolactone was also
restarted.
.
# ST depressions: likely rate-related. Troponin not elevated.
Repeat EKG back to baseline.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 44065**],
It was a pleasure caring for you at [**Hospital1 827**]. You were admitted for infection in your legs and
you were also found to have low blood pressure requiring brief
care in the intensive care unit. For your leg infection, we
treated you with antibiotics and you will complete a 14-day
course. We also performed aggressive wound care on your legs to
help keep the wounds clean and dry.
.
We made the following changes to your medication:
We STARTED Vancomycin - 1 g every 8 hours for leg infection to
be taken for 9 more days - last day is [**12-5**].
We CONTINUED Coumadin - it is important for you to have your INR
routinely checked.
We STOPPED torsemide because of low blood pressure - this
medication may need restarted if you begin to have more swelling
in your legs or abdomen
We STARTED oxycontin and oxycodone for pain -> these are very
powerful pain medications and you should take the lowest
possible dose necessary. This medications should be weaned when
your legs begin to heal.
.
You should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2392**] once you are discharged

Brief Hospital Course:
63 y/o F w/ CAD on [**Month/Year (2) **]/[**Month/Year (2) **], hx ovarian CA, hep C, BRCA s/p
modified radical mastectomy c/b hematoma, on wound vac.

#  S/P MRM:  Patient tolerated procedure w/o complication. Has
wound VAC in place after removing out ~200cc blood from
hematoma.  Her HCT was monitored carefully in setting of recent
[**Month/Year (2) **] administration.  Pain was controlled with PCA.  She was
given post-op cefazolin 2g IV for 3 doses. While in the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**]
ICU, she was transfused a total of 2 units of packed RBCs, with
a subsequent hematocrit of 29.7. She was subsequently
transferred to the surgical floor. Her HCT continued to be
stable for the remainder of her admission and her wound VAC
output and her wound were monitored for evidence of further
hematoma or bleeding, of which none was demonstrated. The
patient continued to do well and on POD 6 was taken back to the
OR where a split thickness skin graft from her left thigh was
placed on the surgical wound. This was held in place using an
additional wound VAC on low continuous suction (50mmHg), and was
removed on POD6. During the dressing change, the skin graft was
well granulated and continued to appear viable.

#  CAD:  DES to LAD c/b instent re-stenosis, crucial to continue
[**Hospital Ward Name **] even during surgery as cardiac risks are significant.
Patient was continued on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], carvedilol, and high-dose
statin. She was followed throughout the admission.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: On [**4-25**], the patient was nearing transfer
out of the ICU, but subsequently developed atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response, with a heart rate in the high
130s. She was given normal saline boluses, occasional doses of
intravenous metoprolol, and the dose of her standing carvedilol
was increased. She was not symptomatic from these episodes, and
her heart rate was subsequently under good control, for the rest
of her stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. She did continued to require increased
doses of carvedilol compared to admission for rate control of
her atrial fibrillation.

#  CHRONIC PAIN:  Patient was continued on methadone 10mg QID,
oxycodone 60mg IR TID, and standing Tylenol q6 hours. A
hydromorphone PCA was added on [**4-25**]. She was seen by the chronic
pain service for further assistance with her regimen, and was
eventually stabilized on a regimen of methadone QID
(15mg,10mg,10mg,15mg respectively) and Dilaudid 2-8mg PO q3hrs
prn with good results. The patient did require IV pain control
(Dilaudid) along with Ativan for dressing changes, but did not
require additional pain medications at other times. Upon
discharge an EKG was preformed at the recommendation of the
chronic pain service to evaluate the patient's QT interval after
increasing her methadone dose. The QTc interval was prolonged
however this appeared to be the patient's baseline. Chronic pain
was consulted again over the phone related to this finding and
advised that the patient return to her home dose of methadone
10mg four times daily and be seen in follow up by her  primary
care provider. [**Name10 (NameIs) 6**] appointment with the patient's primary care
provider was made and the provider was called and made aware of
the need for a follow-up EKG. She was discharge home with this
dose of Methadone as well as Dilaudid as needed by mouth.

# DECONDITIONING: ON HD5 the patient was seen by physical
therapy who recommended several inpatient visits and training,
and this was performed while the patient was admitted.

#Social Work and Discharge Plan: The patient is followed by
[**Hospital1 18**] social work on an outpatient basis and the inpatient
social worker connected with this provider during the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital stay related to coping and home safety. Due to some
social situations at home the surgical team requested that
social work to assess the safety of the patient home environment
and social work evaluated the patient's situation and reported
it appropriate for her return. Visiting nursing services were
coordinated and will be following the patient's progress and
preforming daily dressing changes to the left breast.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for surgical treatment of
cancer in your left breast. You had a mastectomy of the left
breast on [**2178-4-24**]. After this procedure because of the blood
thinning medication you take for the stent in your heart, you
had some bleeding under the skin at the surgical site. This
bleeding was stopped and the blood was washed out from the skin.
The wound was left open after this procedure and a VAC dressing
was placed, this allowed for the tissue at the base of the wound
to be kept clean and begin to grow. After some time with the VAC
dressing a split thickness skin graft. You know will be able to
go home with a xeroform dressing with a dry gauze sterile
dressing over the skin graft on the left breast which will be
monitored and changed daily by a visiting nurse who will come to
your home. The donor site on your left tigh can be left  with a
xeroform dressing and dry sterile dressing. The xeroform will
eventually dry and lift off but this will happen on its own, it

Brief Hospital Course:
50 y.o. male with chronic LBP, a remote h/o gastric ulcer and
EtOH abuse p/w multiple episodes of BRBPR and positive NGL after
NSAID intake for LBP.  Pt was hemodynamically stable but
admitted to the MICU for observation. He received [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV.
His Hct remained stable in the ICU and his was transfered to the
floor the next day. He received an EGD and colonoscopy. The EGD
did not show any bleeding source. The colonoscopy showed two
polyps and possible ischemic colitis which may have been the
source of bleeding. The patient was counseled to avoid
substances that can cause ischemic colitis - NSAIDS,HCTZ,
cocaine, etc. He will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding the
pathology results. He had no further episodes of bleeding while
the in the hospital. Due the fact NSAIDs were held, he received
morphine for his chronic back pain; his was discharged with
Tylenol, a new prescription for a Lidocaine patch as well as a
pain clinic appointment. He did have mild abdominal pain which
resolved prior to discharge. This pain was evaluated with CT,
LFT's, amylase and lipase all of which were normal. He was
scheduled to have his right buttock mass evaluated with
ultrasound as an outpatient if it does not resolve in the next
two weeks.

100 tylenol PM (acetaminophen, and diphenhydramine)  and 3
tablets of Nyquil  (dextromethorphan, pseudoephedrine,
acetaminophen, doxylamine). The patient reports that she wanted
to die and fell asleep after taking all the pills. Patient was
suprised to wake-up and went to her day program on Thurs am (30
hours after the tylenol ingestion). At her day program at
[**Location (un) **]Mental Health Program she told her psychiatrist
about her suicide attempt and was immediately transferred to
[**Hospital 7188**] Hospital. In ED she was started on oral Mucomyst (N-AC)
which she vomited. She was then stated on Mucomyst 18.4gm
loading, 6.1 gm for 4 hours, then 12.3gms until transfer to

progressed INR 1.2 to 1.9 and ALT 244 to 1783, AST 265 to 1851,
and Biliribin 1.7 on transfer. Her plasma tylenol level at
transfer was 89 mcg/mL (40-fold in the toxic range according to
the RIMAC nomogram). She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care due to non-resolving LFTs.

Upon arrival, the patient endorsed diffuse abdominal pain. The
patient regrets her suicide attempt. She reports she is

CXR ([**9-8**]):

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Acetaminophen overdose:  The patient took over 100 pills of
Tylenol p.m. by her account. On presentation to [**Hospital 7188**] Hospital
30 hours after ingestion, she had an acetaminophen level of 89.9
mcg/mL, placing her at high risk for fulminant hepatic failure.
She was treated with N-acetylcysteine at [**Hospital 7188**] Hospital as
noted in HPI.  At [**Hospital1 18**], she was treated with N-acetylcysteine
50 mg/kg every 4 hours. She did well during her stay in the MICU
and was able to be called out to the floor on day 2. Her
transaminases continued to trend down and her INR remained
stable below 2.0 after peaking on the first hospital day, and
the N-acetylcysteine was stopped after 5 days of treatment. A
repeat serum acetaminophen level was negative. She had no
encephalopathy or other evidence of liver failure, and her mild
coagulopathy continually improved.

2) Diphenhydramine overdose:  The patient overdosed on Tylenol
p.m., which contains both acetaminophen and diphenhydramine.
Likely as a result of this ingestion, the patient experienced
sedation, urinary retention, and visual hallucination. However,
these symptoms had resolved by the time the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and her foley was discontinued.

3) Suicide attempt:  While at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was followed by
the psychiatric consult service. She had a 1:1 sitter during her
first and second hospital days.  This was discontinued during
the second hospital day at the recommendation of the psychiatric
service. The patient's outpatient psychiatric providers were
contact[**Name (NI) **] to obtain collateral information, which is described
under PMH and in psychiatric consult notes. She currently denies
suicidal ideations, but will need inpatient psychiatric
placement now that she is medically cleared.

4) Renal dysfunction:  The patient presented with mildly
elevated creatinine and mild proteinuria. It is unclear if this
was acute or chronic. The patient's renal function was followed
closely during her hospitalization given the risk of kidney
injury from acetaminophen overdose. Her creatinine improved from
1.3 to 1.0 during admission.

5) UTI:  Complicated due to presence of foley early during her
hospitalization. Pt denies urinary symptoms, but initially had
mild suprapubic tenderness. Urine culture grew Citrobacter,
sensitive to ciprofloxacin. She is to complete a 7 day course of
ciprofloxacin.

6) Disposition: Patient is medically cleared for transfer to
inpatient psychiatry. This is evidenced by dramatic improvement
in her LFTs. Physical therapy has evaluated the patient and
believes she can ambulate independently.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 47-year-old woman with a pmhx. significant for alcohol
abuse and bipolar disorder who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for acute
liver failure, acute kidney injury, and altered mental status.
According to records obtained from various outside facilities,
patient was brought into [**Hospital6 6640**] on [**2102-3-18**] by
a friend who was concerned that patient was ""drinking a pint of
vodka"" for the past 5 days.  At that time, patient declined
detox, and checked out of the hospital, stating that she would
follow-up with her outpatient therapist.  On [**3-19**], patient had a
normal chemistry panel (BUN of of 20, creatinine of 0.8), AST of
28, ALT of 27, acetaminophen level of <2.0 and serum alcohol
level of 360.  Patient denied SI and was discharged home.
.
The following day ([**3-20**]), patient was admitted to NORCAP Lodge
(detox facility) in [**Location (un) 26671**], where she was monitored for ETOH
and ?opiate withdrawal.  She was given clonidine (in tapered
doses), acetaminophen (total of 3 doses of 325mg over 2 days),
mylanta, benadryl, motrin, imodium, ativan, melatonin, reglan,
triaminic cold relief, and desyrel per withdrawal protocol.
Patient also reports taking ""8 vicodin) on [**3-21**] for shoulder
pain, stating that she is prescribed 24 pills of vicodin/month
by her physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to healthcare providers at NORCAP,
patient complained of extreme nausea and abdominal pain on [**3-22**],
and she was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further work-up.
.
At [**Hospital3 **], patient was found to have a serum acetaminophen
level of <10 but positive urine level, an ETOH level of 10,
lipase of 798, bili of 1.9, AST of [**Numeric Identifier 16092**], ALT of 8010, and
ultrasound with trace ascites and normal portal and hepatic
flow.  Patient was given zofran, magnesium, and 9545mg of NAC
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were: 98.7 74 172/108 16 100%.  She
was given 2 L of IVF, 3.25grams of NAC, 4mg IV morphine, cipro
400mg for presumed UTI, and seen by transplant, hepatology, and
toxicology services.  LFTs were trending down with AST of [**Numeric Identifier 4731**],
ALT of 6585, LDH: 8245, and lipase of 840.  BUN/ creatinine was
47/4.7, and patient was making minimal concentrated urine.  RUQ
ultrasound showed good portal and hepatic flow, and CT abdomen
(without contrast) was remarkable only for pancreatic stranding.
 Patient was deemed not to be a transplant candidate due to her
current ETOH abuse, and was admitted to the MICU for further
work-up and treatment.

Past Medical History:
--ETOH abuse
--Bipolar disorder
--History of acetaminophen overdose as a teenager (was taking it
for menstrual cramps) and needed to get her ""stomach pumped""

Brief Hospital Course:
47-year-old woman with a history of ETOH abuse who is
transferred from OSH for acute ETOH and Tylenol hepatitis,
pancreatitis, ARF, and altered mental status.

# Acute Renal Failure: Due to tylenol toxicity, which can occur
in up to 50% of pts with acetaminophen induced fulminant hepatic
failure. Pt with primary AG metabolic acidosis from uremia. Pt
was started on HD for acidosis and continued on this for volume
overload. She was transiently given sodium bicarb supplements.
She was also given replacement dosing Vit D (Vit D=13)
supplements. Remainder of electrolytes stayed within normal
limits.  Pt had complete pre-HD workup with negative hepatitis
panel and PPD negative.  Starting [**2102-4-6**], her urine output
increased remarkably (~4-5L urine output daily) as she entered
the diuresis stage of ATN and HD was discontinued.  She required
fluid boluses to maintain euvolemia, and was encouraged to drink
2-3L of oral fluids until her urine output decreases.

#Septic Thrombophlebitis: Pt had left dorsum of hand septic
thrombophlebitis from IV line infection. 4 blood cultures
positve for GPC and she had fevers of 100.8. Pt was given
vancomycin IV with hemodialysis with goal trough 15-20. Given
development of thrombocytopenia, patient switched from
vancomycin to daptomycin. 1st dose of daptomycin 400 mg IV q48h
on [**2102-4-10**] and 2nd dose on [**2102-4-12**]. She received transthoracic
echocardiogram which did not show valvular vegetation.
Thrombophlebitis healed well and she will f/u with ID and
continue on daptomycin until [**2102-4-29**].

# Fulminant Hepatitis: secondary to ETOH coupled with
acetaminphen toxicity.  Completed course of NAC IV for 20 hrs
and had impressive improvement of hepatic function. Over course
of admission LFTs downtrended AST 20,000->35 and ALT 8000->50s.
INR and Tbili normalized.  Workup for other etiologies of
hepatitis was negative. She will follow with hepatology as
outpatient for further monitoring of liver failure.

# Pancreatitis: Likely secondary to ETOH. Over course of
admission, lipase downtrended 840->100->78. She was kept NPO
until abd pain improved and was given dilaudid for pain control.
MRCP showed no signs of necrosis or pseudocysts or complications
of pancreatits.  Her diet was advanced to regular which she
tolerated well.

# Altered Mental Status: Initially presented with somonlence
likely multifactorial: ETOH withdrawel, benzos, renal failure,
hepative failure.  Last drink [**3-21**] or [**3-22**]. She was initialy
started on CIWA and then weaned off. Pts mental status cleared
and she became lucid and was discharged with normal mental
status.

# Substance Abuse: Psych evaluated pt and did not see any signs
of suicidaility. They did not recommend antidepressents in the
setting of acute illness. Pt encouraged to continue psych follow
up after discharge.  She was quite anxious throughout her stay
requiring intermittent benzodiazepines.  These should be
discontinued one week after discharge (only 5 tabs provided upon
discharge) in order to avoid the possibility of continued
substance abuse.

# UTI: E. coli UTI sensitive to cipro. She completed 7 day
course for complicated cystitis.

# Hypertension: Pt with HTN (160s) and was started on amlodipine
5mg daily, which was later uptitrated to 7.5 mg daily.  She has
a PCP follow up appointment in 1 week at which time BP can be
evaluated and medication regimen changed if needed.

She was full code for this admission.  She will be discharged to
home (independently ambulating and was evaluated by physical
therapy) where her mother will be living with her for several
weeks to aid in her care.

Transition of Care:
-renal follow up: plan for complete recovering of renal
function. Continue to assess renal function regularly and urine
output.
-needs continued psych support for her drug addiction and
depressive issues
-needs continued follow up with hepatology service to continue
to assess liver
-needs PCP f/u for blood pressure management
-needs ID f/u for complete resolution of MRSA bacteremia,
Outpatient lab results planned and will be faxed to ID

Discharge Diagnosis:
Fulmanent Hepatitic failure - secondary to alcohol and tylenol
Acute renal failure- acute tubular necrosis secondary to tylenol
Pancreatitis
MRSA bactermia
Normocytic anemia - due to renal failure
Alcohol withdrawl
Urinary Tract Infection
Alcohol abuse


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for alcohol and tylenol
toxicity. Your liver, pancreas and kidneys were all severely
inflamed and affected by these drugs. We urge you to continue to
get help regarding your drinking and drug abuse problems. This
is very serious. Drugs can damage your organs and be fatal.

Your liver function gradually improved with time. You were given
NAC, a medicine to help oppose the dangerous effects that
tylenol has on the liver. You have an follow up appointment with
the liver center (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as detailed below.  Your liver
function tests will be completed at that time.

You had a pancreatitis which caused your abdominal pain. It
gradually improved and you tolerated a regular diet.

Your kidneys were not functioning normally and you were started
on hemodialysis temporarily to clear your body toxins.  However,
during your admission your kidney function has improved and you
are urinating which is a good prognostic sign.  You will not
need dialysis upon leaving the hospital, but you should follow
closely with your new kidney doctor.  Because you are urinating
a lot, please continue to drink 2-3 liters of fluid by mouth
daily until your urine output decreases.

You also developed an infection in your skin around an IV site
that resulted in a blood infection with Methicillin Resistant
Staph Aureus.  You received a PICC line and will be receiving
antibiotics until [**2102-4-29**] for this infection.  Home nursing
services will administer this antibiotic for you.  You received
an echocardiogram which did not show infection on the valves in
your heart.  You will follow up with the infectious disease
doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 7928**].

You have anemia likely due to your kidney failure and received
blood transfusions.  As your kidney's recover, your anemia is
expected to improve.

Medication Changes:
START multivitamin 1 tab daily
START nicotine patch 14mg daily x6 weeks then 7mg daily x2 weeks
then stop.  YOU CANNOT SMOKE WHILE ON THE PATCH
START amlodipine 7.5mg daily
START vitamin D 50,000 units daily x7 weeks then vitamin D
1000units daily thereafter(this can be found over the counter)
START zofran 4mg by mouth every 4-6 hours as needed for nausea
START daptomycin 400mg IV every other day until [**2102-4-29**]
START lorazepam 0.5mg 1 tab at night for anxiety
START calcium carbonate 500mg three times daily (TAKE WITH
MEALS) - this is important to lower your phosphorus

It was a pleasure caring for you.  We wish you a speedy
recovery.

coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90583**] is a 71 year-old lady with a past medical history of
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity
presenting from PCP's office after a syncopal episode/Code blue
event, found to have inferior STEMI, now s/p 1 DES to mid-RCA
for 90% occlusion.  At her PCP's office, the patient had
apparently been complaining of nausea and lightheadedness prior
to the episode.  Per Atrius note, patient was sitting in the
waiting room and slumped over in her chair, witnessed by MA.
Patient was unresponsive and had ""no heart rate.""  Chest
compressions were started, code was called.  Pads were placed,
heart rate 114 in atrial fibrillation, patient spontaneously
regained conciousness, was alert and oriented.  She was given
ASA 325 mg.
.
At 14:40, while en route to [**Hospital1 18**] with EMS, EKG showed ST
elevations in II, III, aVF and V3-V6, with reciprocal
depressions in I and aVL.  On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED at 14:57,
initial EKG had similar findings also with Q waves ST depression
in V2.  Patient was taken to the Cath Lab, where initial vital
signs were BP 149/114 HR 40s RR 20 SaO2 96% 2L.  FSBS was noted
to be in the 500s.  Access was attempted through RFA and RRA,
and eventually gained through LFA at 15:42.  She was found to
have a mid-LAD elsion of 50-60% with extension into the diagnoal
branch and TIMI 3 flow into the distal LAD, LCx with moderate
luminal irregularities in the mid-vessel, and a calcified RCA
with 90% stenosis, which was stented with 1 DES.  For her
bradycardia during the procedure, a temp wire was placed at the
RV apex and paced 70 bpm, and for her hypotension, dopamine drip
was started at 5-15 mcg/kg/min.
.
On arrival to the CCU, initial vital signs were 96.2 101/58 127
36 86%.  The patient was agitated and turning cyanotic.  She was
minimally responsive with sats in the 60-70%s.  She was bagged.
Femoral and carotid pulse were not palpable.  One chest
compression was attempted and she bolted upright in bed.
Subsequent vital signs were 95/42 113 33 100% 2L.
.
Of note, patient had been discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] with bilateral
cellulitis and acute renal failure.  On discharge, her
lisinopril, lasix, and atenolol had been held.  Lisinopril and
Lasix were restarted on [**8-16**], but atenolol was still held.
Additionally, she was noted to have a rash that was hypothesized
to be secondary to antibiotics.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations.

Imaging:
[**2143-8-28**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed
one-vessel disease. The LMCa had no angiographically apparent
disease.
The LAD had a 50-60% stenosis in the mid vessel and a large
diagonal
branch had an ostial 50-60% stenosis. The LCx had moderate
luminal
irregularities. The RCA was calcified and had a distal hazy 90%
stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left- and
right-sided
filling pressures, with an RVEDP of 15 mm Hg and a PCWP of 18 mm
Hg.
There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension,
with a
PASP of 50 mm Hg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.7
L/min/m2. There
was no gradient upon pullback of the catheter from the left
ventricle to
the aorta.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal RCA with a 2.5 x
15 mm
Promus [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 2.75 (see PTCA comments).
4. Successful placement of temporary pacing wire (see PTCA
comments).
5. Successful RFA AngioSeal (see PTCA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Inferior STEMI.
2. One-vessel coronary artery disease.
3. Mildly elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures with
a preserved cardiac index.
4. Successful PCI of the distal RCA with a 2.5 x 15 mm Promus
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 2.75 mm.
5. Successful LFA AngioSeal.
.
[**2143-8-28**] TTE:
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus. Left
ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be excluded. The right ventricle is
not well seen but may be mildly dilated and hypokinetic.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-7-17**],
suboptimal quality persists. The right ventricle may be
dilated/hypokinetic on BOTH studies. The estimated pulmonary
pressure is higher on the current study.
.
[**2143-8-28**] Chest x-ray:
The lung volumes are low. Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of
mild
interstitial fluid retention. Calcified structure projecting
over the right lung apex, potentially belonging to the right
first rib. No major pleural effusions, but areas of bilateral
basal atelectasis are seen. No evidence of pneumonia.
.
[**2143-8-29**] Cardiac cath:
Selective coronary angiography of the RCA in this right dominant
system
demonstrated no flow limiting coronary artery disease with TIMI
3 flow
and a widely patent RCA stent.  Due to concerns regarding
multiple IV
contrast loads in a short perior of time in this patient with
baseline
renal dysfunction, and the lack of ischemic changes other than
inferior
ST elevations, the LMCA/LAD/LCX were not assessed. Resting
hemodynamics
revealed mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures
with a
mean RA pressure of 13 mmHg, a RVEDP of 14 mmHg, and a LVEDP of
18 mmHg.
The cardiac output/index were normal at 6.3/3.2.  The systemic
vascular
resistance was low normal at 813 dynes-sec/cm5 and the pulmonary

vascular resistance was normal at 114 dynes-sec/cm5.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Patent RCA stent with TIMI 3 flow in the RCA
2. Mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures
3. Normal cardiac output/index
4. Low normal systemic vascular resistance.
.
[**2143-8-29**] TTE:
Patient is on dopamine. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function appears grossly normal. The
inferior and posterior walls were not well-visualized. The RV is
not well seen. An epicardial fat pad is seen. A pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
.
[**2143-8-29**] TTE:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to
hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility
(primarily due to severe infundibular hypokinesis). The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2143-8-29**] Lower extremity U/S:
No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of right or left lower extremity DVT
with the above limitations.
.
[**2143-8-29**] Non-contrast CT abd/pelvis:
Right thigh edema/ecchymosis without evidence for active
hemorrhage or focal fluid collection.
.
[**2143-8-31**] Chest x-ray:
The right PICC line tip is at the level of the proximal right
atrium and
should be pulled back approximately 3 cm to place it at the
cavoatrial
junction. The Swan-Ganz catheter inserted through the femoral
approach is
noted, located slightly higher than expected most likely still
within the main pulmonary artery. Interstitial pulmonary edema
is seen as well as bibasilar atelectasis and most likely present
bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90583**] is a 71 year-old lady with a past medical history of
type 2 diabetes (last hgbA1c 12.4%), hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, obesity presenting from PCP's office after a
syncopal episode/Code blue event, found to have RCA STEMI, now
s/p 1 DES to mid-RCA for 90% occlusion, with phsiology
suggestive of RV infarction.  Hospital course also complicated
by anemia, hyperglycemia and a subclincal UTI.
.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# STEMI: From 90% occlusion of RCA with RV infarct physiology.
Most likely, her syncopal episode and bradycardia were related
to inferior MI and increased vagal tone.  Culprit lesion was
stented with 1 DES. Initially, the patient was hemodynamically
unstable with episodes of afib with RVR alternating with
bradycardia along with hypotension requiring dopamine, IV fluid
and two units PRBCs, due to preload dependence.  She was
monitored on telemetry with restoration and maintenance of sinus
rhythm.  She was weaned off dopamine, with stable blood
pressures.  Her medical management was optimized with initial
integrillin drip, then aspirin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg
daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily and aggressive blood glucose
control.  Once blood pressures were stable, the patient was also
started on metoprolol and lisinopril. Post-cath TTE showed LVEF=
45 % secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior
walls.  At the time of discharge, the patient was chest
pain-free and hemodynamically stable. Her medications at
discharge were adjusted to include as many generic medications
as possible but clopidogrel is essential for the next year and
there is no generic equivalent. She will need a social work
consult to help her with medications.
.
# Anemia: During this hospitalization, the patient was noted to
have a slowly down-trending hematocrit, which was attributed to
peri-procedural bleeding.  There were no other obvious sources
of bleed.  She was transfused two units PRBCs with good
response. Hematocrit was stable upon discharge.
.
#  Hyperglycemia/diabetes: Patient has very poorly controlled
diabetes at her baseline with A1C of 12.5. She was supposed to
be on glargine with humalog SS at home, but for financial and
compliance reasons she only took humalog, and only
intermittently. In setting of STEMI, her blood glucose was
controlled aggressively with an insulin drip.  [**Last Name (un) **] consult
provided advice and teaching re: [**Hospital1 **] 70/30 dosing. Additionally,
the patient received education regarding her diet but admits she
eats what she wants. She has a f/u appt with [**Hospital **] clinic in
[**Month (only) 1096**].

# Asymptomatic UTI: Patient was noted to have 10-100K colonies
of pan-sensitive proteus in her urine, but was asymptomatic.  No
treatment was pursused.  Subsequent urine culture only grew 1000
colonies, which is not significant
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# CKD: Documented history of this problem.  Creatinine was
stable, and all medications were renally-dosed
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- please evaluate whether medications at home will be affordable
to pt.
- pt needs VNA with social worker at home after discharge
- please help pt replace cane with seat that was lost here
- please check fingersticks before meals and adjust NPH/regular
dosing for target blood sugar of 120.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**].

You had a heart attack and a blockage was found in the right
coronary artery. This blockage was cleared and a drug eluting
stent was placed in the artery to prevent it from blocking
again. Your heart rate was low and you required a pacing wire to
keep your heart rate up temporarily. You will be on aspirin and
clopidogrel (Plavix) every day for at least one year and
possibly longer. Do not miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] or stop taking Plavix and
aspirin unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] tells you it is OK to do so. You risk
having another heart attack if you do not take Plavix and
aspirin daily. Your blood sugars were very high here and we
adjusted your insulin to a combination short and long acting
version to better contol your blood sugars.
.
We made the following changes to your medicines:
1. START aspirin to prevent another heart attack
2. START clopidogrel (Plavix) to prevent the stents [**Last Name (un) 834**]
clotting off. This is extremely important to take this medicine
daily, do not miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] or stop taking this medicine unless
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] tells you to. This is very important to prevent another
heart attack.
3. Resume atenolol to lower your heart rate
4. Change glargine insulin to 70/30 insulin twice daily to lower
your blood sugar. Please take before breakfast and dinner.
5. Decrease the lisinopril to 10 mg daily
6. Increase the furosemide (Lasix) to 40 mg in the morning and
20 mg at 2pm to get rid of extra fluid in your legs.
7. STart miralax to prevent constipation
8. Start calcium with vitamin D to prevent bone breakdown.
9. STart tylenol as needed for pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
48 year-old left-handed man with a reported history of a
traumatic subdural hematoma s/p left parietal craniotomy in
[**2079**], no reported prior seizure history, and alleged distant
alcohol abuse who presents as a direct transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**]
Neuro-ICU from [**Hospital6 2561**] for further evaluation and
management of refractory seizures.  He was apparently in his
USOH until last evening at 11:30 pm, when he was ""noted to be
talking incoherently"", and subsequently rolled from bed to the
floor.  He was then witnessed by his significant other to have
""shaking arms and legs in a fetal position,"" approximately [**12-8**]
minutes in duration.  His girlfriend immediately called EMS.
The patient apparently suffered a laceration to his left
forehead from the fall and bit his tongue, but did not
experience any form of incontinence.  Blood glucose on the scene
was 98, heart rhythm is normal.  He remained in a ""post-ictal""
confusional state and was brought to the [**Hospital6 2561**]
ED, where he was noted to be amnestic for the event.

He was brought to [**Hospital3 **], where he regained ""full
consciousness"" in the ED.  His initial mental status was
described as ""lucid,"" as well as ""alert and oriented x 3, no
evidence of acute psychoses; normal mood.""  He had ""normal
cranial nerves [pupils equal at 4 mm and reactive, fundi
""benign""].  Sensation was ""normal to fine touch or pin
throughout"" and strength was described as ""[**4-11**]+ all 4
extremities.""  Cerebellar examination revealed ""normal
finger-to-nose"" and gait was ""normal.""  A Romberg was negative.
Given resolution and return to baseline, the plan was for
discharge.  However, he had another generalized tonic-clonic
seizure ""within several hours"" in the emergency room
(description unavailable), from which he ""never regained full
consciousness.""  Even after he received four pushes of lorazepam
2 mg IV (8 mg total), he remained very agitated, requiring
security guards to restrain him.  There was apparently a concern
that he was  ""not able to protect his airway"" and was therefore
intubated without complication after receiving succinylcholine
and etomidate.  He was sedated on Propofol and loaded with 1
gram of Dilantin.  He was also documented as having received
vecuronium 10 mg at 3 am, about one-half hour after intubation,
though the indication is unclear (possibly to facilitate LP).

Clinical data included a CBC (WBC normal at 7.5), Chem 10
(glucose 136), LFTs (elevated AST of 84), cardiac enzymes
(elevated CPK 1325 and MB 10.8, normal Trop I less than 0.04).
Urinalysis revealed trace ketones, [**4-16**] wbc, [**4-16**] rbc, [**1-11**] epis,
and [**1-11**] hyaline casts.  Amylase, lipase, TSH were normal.
Phenytoin level at drawn at 4:30 am was 5.9 (albumin 3.6).  He
was ultimately given an additional 500 mg IV dilantin load.
Serum and urine drug screens were negative.  Of note, the
patient received an LP; no opening pressure was recorded.  Tube
1 had 1240 RBC that clear to 6 RBC by Tube 4.  There were 9 WBC
on Tube 1 (21 polys, 26 lymphs, 13 monos), but 0 in Tube 4.
Protein was 44 and glucose was 69.  A urine culture, two blood
cultures, and a CSF culture were pending.  On imaging, the
patient had a non-contrast head CT that revealed that he was
""status post left parietal craniotomy"" but was otherwise
unremarkable and without evidence of acute infarct or
hemorrhage.  C-spine plain film and CT revealed no fracture;
however, there were degenerative changes including
""intervertebral disk space narrowing at multiple levels, worst
at the C3-4, C4-5 and C5-6 vertebral levels.""  CXR showed
appropriate placement of the ETT and NGT, though no comment is
made regarding infiltrates or possible pneumonic processes.  An
MRI of the head with and without contrast was ordered, but not
performed.

Records indicate that he was brought to the ICU in ""stable""
condition.  There, he reportedly had several episodes of full
body shaking described as rigor-like for ~30 seconds, and
associated with pupillary dilation.  These episodes resolved as
Propfol was increased.  As there was a concern for subclinical
seizures with a need for LTM monitoring, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.

Review of Systems:
Patient unable to provide at this time due to intubation and
sedation. Per documentation from [**Hospital3 **], there was ""no
recent trauma, no fevers, chills, headaches, rashes, sick
contacts, travel.  [**Name2 (NI) **] recent illness of any kind.""  While lucid,
the patient also denied neck pain or photophobia.

Past Medical History:
Traumatic subdural hematoma in the setting of a motor vehicle
accident, s/p left parietal craniotomy in [**2079**] (reportedly at
[**Hospital 912**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 1474**])
Alcohol Abuse

Social History:
He lives at home in [**Location 4288**] with his significant other and her
child.  He works in credit card processing and she is reportedly
a pharmacist.  He is apparently quite active and has
participated in triathalons.  He reportedly never smoked, and
had a drinking problem prior to [**2092**].  He was sober for some
time, though his son states that he may have had alcohol 3 weeks
ago.  He had a history of possible MJ and cocaine use many years
ago.  He has had personal difficulties in the form of financial
stress.

Family History:
Brother had seizures after recent motor vehicle accident and is
now on medications for treatment

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year-old man with a reported history of a traumatic subdural
hematoma s/p left parietal craniotomy in [**2079**] and no reported
prior seizure history who presents as a direct transfer to the
[**Hospital1 18**] Neuro-ICU from [**Hospital6 2561**] for further
evaluation and management of refractory seizures and concern for
subclinical seizure activity.  A limited examination after his
prior intubation and sedation is unrevealing at this time.  The
description of initial incomprehensible speech could represent a
partial seizure from a focus near the prior craniotomy site with
secondary generalization.  An initial evaluation at the outside
hospital was notable for the presence of RBC and WBC in the CSF
that cleared, elevated CPK and MB that may have risen due in
some part to the fall, subsequent seizure activity, or forced
restraint by security.  In the setting of a history of alcohol
abuse and possible recurrence, an elevated AST/ALT ratio could
reflect alcoholic hepatitis.  Thus an indetectable serum alcohol
level could suggest a withdrawal seizure.  The patient had a a
full toxic, metabolic, and infectious evaluation.
He received dilantin 100mg TID during ICU; was then started on
keppra on transfer to Neurology floor. Patient was extubated

Brief Hospital Course:
27 year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus, admitted to the
ICU with DKA.  There were no signs of any localizing infections.
 Trigger may be related to emotional stressors.  Patient
recently disclosed to her family regarding childhood sexual
abuse by her aunt's boyfriend. DKA was managed with aggressive
fluid repletion and insulin infusion.  Once adequately improved,
she moved to the medicine floor where her insulin regimen was
slightly adjusted because of hypoglycemia.

PROBLEM LIST:
# DKA: Unclear trigger, possibly emotional stressor.  Resolved
with insulin and IV fluid administration.

# DM, type I, uncontrolled with complications (gastroparesis):
- Lantus reduced from 24 to 20 units QHS
- Sliding scale humalog with meals
- Continued [**Last Name (un) **] follow-up

# Nausea, vomiting: While the patient does have diabetic
gastroparesis, she also has increased nausea/vomiting relating
to emotional trauma from her childhood abuse (as reported by
social work)

# Anxiety / sexual abuse: Patient was sexually abused as a
child, and, for the first time, disclosed this to her mother
just one week prior to admission. Psychiatry was consulted in
the emergency room and recommended to consider in-home services
such as a psychiatric VNA at discharge. Social work has been
very involved during this hospitalization in working with the
patient. The patient's mood and affect are actually much
brighter than in prior admissions.

# Chronic back pain: Dilaudid and oxycodone used initially
during admission.  These were discontinued as to not exacerbate
diabetic gastroparesis.  Tramadol used sparingly.  Gabapentin
has been effective in the past, but the patient discontinued use
of this because of nausea.  It is possible that the increased
nausea from Gabapentin may have been from developing DKA or
worsening gastroparesis.  She was amenable to restarting
Gabapentin at a lower dose and titrating back up as tolerated.

# HTN: Continue Lisinopril

# Bacteruria-- >100K staph in urine, d/w lab, this is not
saprophyticus, just regular coag negative staph. Given absence
of [**Last Name (un) **], and minimal pyuria, no need for antibiotics at this
time.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Close follow-up with [**Hospital3 **] and clinical
pharmacist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) regarding management of diabetes and
chronic back pain
- Close follow-up [**Last Name (un) **] providers regarding diabetes management
- Close follow-up with social work and considering other mental
health services for continued support with regard to her recent
disclosure of childhood sexual abuse.

Discharge Diagnosis:
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- Chronic back pain
- Diabetic gastroparesis


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and high blood
sugar and were admitted to the ICU for management of diabetic
ketoacidosis.  Your condition was stabilized intravenous insulin
and fluids.  On the medicine floor, adjustments were made to
your insulin regimen to try to get your blood sugars into the
more normal range. Please contact the 24 hour [**Last Name (un) 387**] line if
your blood sugars are too high or too low.

For your chronic back pain, it would be in your best interest to
avoid/minimize opiod pain medications (like Oxycodone, Dilaudid,
and even Tramadol).  These medications can exacerbate your
diabetic gastroparesis.  Gabapentin was restarted in the
hospital which has provided you some symptom relief in the past.
 This medication can be slowly increased as you can tolerate.

Please continue to seek support through your family, primary
care clinic, and social work as you continue to deal with trauma
from past physical abuse.

MEDICATION CHANGES:
- Lantus insulin reduced to 17 units at night (previously 24
units)
- Gabapentin restarted at 100 mg twice daily.  If tolerated, may
increase up to 200 mg twice daily as tolerated. Please work with
your primary care provider if you have any questions regarding
this medication.

IMAGING:
[**10-23**] Foot X-ray
FINDINGS: A cutaneous defect is noted at the lateral and
inferior aspect of the fifth metatarsal head. There is
subcutaneous emphysema tracking around the distal fifth
metatarsal along with adjacent soft tissue swelling. There is no
periosteal new bone formation or osseous destruction detected.
No acute fracture or dislocation is detected. There are hallux
valgus and metatarsus varus deformities with hyperostosis along
the medial aspect of the distal first metatarsal. Degenerative
changes are noted at the first MTP joint with joint space
narrowing and dorsal spurring. Large inferior and posterior
calcaneal spurs are also seen. There is a hammertoe deformity at
the second digit. Degenerative changes are seen in the mid foot
at the talonavicular joint. An exaggerated arch is noted. There
is patchy osteopenia. A linear radiopaque density is noted in
the subcutaneous tissue of the right heel which may represent a
foreign body.
IMPRESSION:
1. Radiographic findings suggestive of osteomyelitis at the head
of the fifth metatarsal.
2. Possible foreign body in the right heel.
3. Hallux valgus. Hammertoe deformity of the second toe.

[**10-23**] CXR:
Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis but no findings to
suggest pneumonia.

[**10-23**] Bone biopsy:
Pending

Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo F with insulin dependent diabetes presented with DKA and
right foot pain.

# Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Patient's initial anion gap found to be 25 on arrival to the ED.
 Her presentation was most likely secondary to non-compliance
and inability to pay for her insulin.  She was started on an
insulin gtt in the ED, which was continued upon her arrival in
the MICU.  As her gap closed, her IV fluid hydration was
adjusted and she was transitioned to glargine with a sliding
scale as her [**Last Name (un) **] consult recommendations.  Her hemoglobin A1c
was found 12.6.  She was transferred to the general medical
floor on subcutaneous insulin and her blood sugars were
primarily well controlled.

# Right foot osteomyelitis.
The patient presented with pus at the plantar surface of her
right foot.  A deep tissue swab was taken, although after she
had already received antibiotics, and blood cultures were sent.
A foot X ray suggested osteomyelitis at the head of the 5th
metatarsal and possible foreign body in the right heel.
Podiatry was consulted and she was taken to the OR for
debridement and wash out with a bone biopsy twice.  She was
originally started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl.  The
infectious disease team was consulted who recommended that she
transition to ceftriaxone and flagyl as her cultures from the
OSH and in house grew Group B strep and MSSA.  She will require
6 weeks of ceftriaxone from the date of her last
debridement/wash out ([**Date range (1) 91603**]).  She was continued on flagyl
due to loose stools, please see below.

# HTN.
SBP was noted to be in the 170s upon arrival.  She was initially
treated with IV antihypertensives and transitioned to lisinopril
in the MICU.  She continued to be hypertensive during the course
of her stay.  The patient noted a cough a few days into her
course of lisinopril and she was transitioned to valsartan and
later losartan for a generic antihypertensive.

# Loose stools
Upon arrival to the general medical floor, the patient began to
report loose stools.  Cdiff studies were sent and were negative.
 The patient continued to report loose stools, although reported
they were improving.  As the patient was being treated with
flagyl, it was not entirely clear if this improvement was due to
the flagyl or resolving of her symptoms naturally.  A cdiff PCR
of the stool was sent and she is to be continued on flagyl po
until the results return.
.
# Substernal chest pressure
As part of her presentation, the patient reported occasionally
substernal chest pressure.  She was ruled out for ACS, but was
noted to have EKG changes, most notably a LAFB.  While no former
EKGs were within our system, this remained stable during her
hospital course and her symptoms resolved and her condition
improved.

# Medication noncompliance
The patient reported that she had not taken her insulin in three
months as she had lost her insurance and was unable to afford
medications.  She met with both the case management and social
work teams who helped her procure insurance so she would be able
to afford her medications in the future.

# Health Insurance Coverage:  application for MassHealth was
completed, and should hopefully be improved by the time of
discharge from rehab to cover home meds including insulin.

Brief Hospital Course:
43 yoM with history of severe depression, MEN 1a s/p
pancreatectomy who presents after unresponsive episode.

# Unresponsive episode: patient was found unconscious at home by
his partner, EMS was called and found to have a SBG in the 40s
was given dextrose and naracan, intubated and brought to the ED.
 Patient was admitted to the ICU where he continued to recieve
dextrose gtt until alert enough for extubation 24 hours later.
Patient was transfered to the floor where he was followed by
[**Last Name (un) 387**] consult service and had his basal glargine titrated to 12
units QAM with a tighter humalog sliding scale.  Thyroid,
coritisol and c-peptide (pending) were sent as patient had
history of MEN1 all of which were normal.  Patient reports
hypoglycemia was unitentional and from forgetting to eat.
Psychiatry was consulted and felt patient lacked appropriate
insight into his illness and were concerned that his actions may
have been suicidial in intent.  Patient was secontioned 12 and
was to be admitted to inpatient psychiatry.  Patient was alert
and oriented and medically clear prior to transfer to
psycihatry.
.
# Leukocytosis: felt to be stress demargination and resolved by
MICU admission.
.
# Depression: Patient has signifcant history of depression under
outpatient management and past history of suicide attempts.
Psychiatry was consulted out of concern that patient's
hypoglycemia was intentional.  Patient continues to have an
increased level of risk given his demonstrating impaired
judgment and impulsiveness resulting in serious medical
consequences, his previous history of suicide
attempt, ongoing unchanged psychosocial stressors, and expressed
concerns about safety outside of the hospital by his outpatient
providers.  Patient was section 12'd and to be admitted to
inpaitent psychiatry.
.
# Diabetes:  Patient was seen by inpatient [**Last Name (un) **] service and
had his basal galargine titrated to 12 units daily with an
uptitrated sliding scale.  Paitent will continue to have [**Last Name (un) 387**]
consultation while in inpatient psychiatry and was medically
cleared for transfer to psychiatry.  His most reccent sliding
scale was
Glargine 12 units SC every AM

.
# Vomitting:  patient with 2 episodes of vomitting intact food
several hours after eating post extubation.  This was felt to be
from possible gastroperesis though patient without a known
history of these symptoms.  He was treated with Zofran PRN with
good effect and medically cleared for inpatient psychiatric
admission.
.
# MEN1:  patient with history of pheochromcytoma, gastrinoma and
hyperparathyroidism diagnosed as MEN1 syndrome status
post-pancreatectomy and spleenectomy.  Patient has insulin
diabetes as discussed above as well as peristantly elevated
gastrin levels.  he was maintained on his home regimen of
pantoparazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] with good effect and medically clear for
inpatient psychiatric admission.
.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: secondary to idodine ablation of grave's
disease, stable on home regimen of levothyroxine 150 mcg for 9.5
doses weekly.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-patient is not on Ace/[**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic nephropathy due to
history of hyperkalemia - should followup as outpatient with his
nephrologist.
-consider having gastric emptying study to evaluate for
gastroperesis.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
coronary catheterization with intervention with 2 bare metal
stents

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 yo male with a past medical history of CAD,
hypertnesion, recurrent nephrolithiasis, arthritis who was in
his baseline state of good health until early this morning, when
he experienced nausea, headache and asked his wife to call EMS.
The patient reports that he has been experiencing about 2 weeks'
worth of right back and flank pain, which he has attributed to
nephrolithiasis, which is a recurrent issue for him, but has not
seen [**Name8 (MD) **] MD, and he has otherwise felt well. He reports that he
went to the bathroom in the early am hours, and he experiences
urinary urgency so he felt that he had to run there. In the
bathroom, he felt nausea and headache and crawled on the floor
to tell his wife to call EMS. He reports that he did not
experience chest pain until he was in the ambulance with EMS.
The pain was located in the anterior chest bilaterally around
the 3rd rib. He was found to have STEMI on EKG. He received
aspirin 81mg x4, heparin bolus and drip, integralin bolus and
drip, plavix 600mg po, nitro bolus and drip.
.
The patient was taken to the cath lab, where he was found to
have normal LMCA, LAD had 40-50% proximal lesion, 100% mid and
80% distal lesion. His left circumflex had 60% distal lesion.
RCA was totally occluded proximally with prominent left to right
collateralls. The patient had BMS placed in the LAD proximally
and distally. The proximal stent placement resulted in profound
no reflow with acute worsening of the ST segment elevation in
the anterior leads. This was treated with nitroprusside 200mcg
with near complete reslution of the angiographic reduced flow
but persistance of the ST segment elevation in the anterior
precordial leads. The patient had no pain and did not have
nausea at the end of the procedure. He was transferred to the
CCU with IV nitroglycerin, IV [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and Plavix.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
83yo male with history of coronary artery disease, htn, hld,
nephrolithiasis, presenting with STEMI, s/p placement of 2 BMS
in the LAD.
.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE - The patient had an STEMI with
ST-elevations in the anterior leads and 100% occlusion of the
mid-LAD and the RCA on admission. He underwent placement of two
bare-metal stents to the LAD. He did have profound no reflow
after placement of the proximal stent, and the patient's ST
elevations initially did not improve post-catheterization,
although the patient did not experience further chest pain and
his clinical symptoms improved. Subsequently, his ST elevations
did improve and his enzymes peaked at a CK of 2273, and a
Troponin of 10.54, CK-MB of 150. He was treated with [**Month/Day/Year 13860**]
for 18-hours, heparin drip until his procedure was completed,
[**Month/Day/Year **], Plavix load and then Plavix 75 mg PO daily for at least one
month given his stent. He initially received Nitroprusside in
the cath lab for the no reflow abnormality and then came to the
CCU on a Nitroglycerin gtt, which was weaned off. He was started
on Metoprolol, Atorvastatin, and Captopril (until he was
transitioned to Lisinopril 5 mg PO daily). He was maintained on
an ACEI, beta-blocker and statin prior to discharge. His
electrolytes were reassuring and we monitored via telemetry.
.
# RHYTHM - The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm this
admission. His EKG was reassuring. He has no history of
dysrrhythmia. We optimized his electrolyte and monitored him via
telemetry.
.
CHRONIC CARE:
.
# HYPERTENSION - The patient's home medications included
Metoprolol, Lisinopril and we maintained him on these agents on
dsicharge following his procedures.
.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - We changed Simvastatin to Atorvastatin high
dose for optimal statin utilization in the setting his known
coronary disease.
.
# GLAUCOMA - Stable without evidence of active visual acuity
issues. Appears at baseline this admission. We continued his
home dosing of Xalatan ophthalamic.
.
# NEPHROLITHIASIS - on admission, the patient endorsed right
flank/back pain for about 2-weeks, which he reported was
consistent with his prior diagnoses of nephrolithiasis - a
recurrent problem for the patient. This diagnosis has not been
confirmed during this admission. His pain is well-controlled as
long as he is immobile in bed. His U/A was negative for
infection and for hematuria.
.
# URINARY RETENTION, INCONTINENCE - We continued the patient on
his home regimen of Oxybutynin, Finasteride and Terazosin.
.
# DEPRESSION - Mood appeared stable this admission and was
continued on his home dosing of Fluoxetine.
.
# GOUT - We continued his home dosing of Allopurinol.
.
# SOCIAL ISSUES - The patient is the primary care giver of a
disabled wife and elderly ([**Age over 90 **] years old) mother-in-law. Social
work was consulted for coping strategies.
.
ISSUES OF TRANSITIONS IN CARE:
1. He will need to take Aspirin and Plavix every day for at
least one month and probably longer to keep the stents from
clotting off and causing another heart attack.
2. Switched his Simvastatin for high dose Atorvastatin in the
setting of coronary ishcemia this admission.
3. Follow-up as outpatient with Cardiology was scheduled.
4. No outstanding laboratory data, microbiologic data or imaging
studies at the time of discharge.

Medications on Admission:
- metoprolol 50mg take 2 tabs qam and 1 tab qpm
- fluoxetine 20mg daily
- oxybutynin 10mg ER daily
- allopurinol 300mg daily
- nabumetone 500mg daily

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**].
You had a heart attack and needed to have an emergency cardiac
catheterization. The catheterizaton showed blockages in many
coronary arteries but there were two severe blockages found that
were causing your heart attack. These blockages were opened and
two bare metal stents were placed to keep them open. You will
need to take aspirin and plavix every day for at least one month
and probably longer to keep the stents from clotting off and
causing another heart attack. Do not stop taking aspirin and
plavix or miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tells you that it is
OK.
Your heart is weak after the heart attack and we have been
watching you closely for signs of fluid overload. So far there
have not been any signs such as swelling in the legs or trouble
breathing. Please weigh yourself every day and let Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
know if your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5
pounds in 3 days.
Your weakened heart also makes the chances of a blood clot or
stroke more likely so you will be started on warfarin (coumadin)
for the next few months to thin your blood. You need to take
warfarin every day, the [**Hospital3 **] at [**Hospital1 **] will tell you how much coumadin to take every day. Until
your warfarin level is more than 2.0, you will need to give
yourself Lovenox injections twice daily. The visiting nurse can
help you with all of these medication changes.
.
We made the following changes to your medicines:
1. START taking Clopidogrel (Plavix) every day to keep the stent
open.
2. Continue to take aspirin 325 mg (not a baby) every day with
the clopidogrel
3. Change the metoprolol to a long acting version and decrease
the dose to 50 mg daily as your heart needs a lower dose
4. STOP nabumetone for now
5. STOP taking simvastatin, take atorvastatin (Lipitor) instead
at a high dose to help your heart recover from the heart attack.

6. START taking warfarin (coumadin) to prevent a blood clot or
stroke.
7. START taking lovenox twice daily injections until the
warfarin level is between 2.0 and 3.0.

([**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 745**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3714**]). Found to be hypotensive and given 100mg
hydrocortisone and 3L IVF at OSH. SBP remained 65-80 and pt was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hypotension;
concern for possible sepsis or adrenal crisis. Pt reports some
epigastric pain prior to vomitting, also some lingering cough
from a pneumonia she was recovering from during prior
hospitalizaition several weeks ago. Also noted some mild leg
swelling and ?SOB. B/c of N/V pt did not take any of her meds on
Friday.

At [**Hospital1 18**], initial VS were: 96.7 76 83/47 19 93% 4L NC, although
SBP dropped to 65 when sitting up. She has received 1L IVF here
(probably 5L total incl EMS and OSH). Exam with L basilar
crackles, patient mentating well, good UOP. Bedside U/S showed
30% IVC collapse with respiration, no pericardial effusion, no
abdominal fluid. Has RIJ and got vanc, pip-tazo. VS at time of

[**2173-4-24**] CXR:

Right IJ line ends at the cavoatrial junction. Thre is no
pneumothorax.
There are mild reticular bibasilar opacities and mild vascular
congestion.
Right basilar opacity has mildly improved. Mild hyperinflation
of the lungs.
Calcified granulomas at the right lung apex are stable.

IMPRESSION: Mild vascular congestion. Improving right bascilar
opacity.
.
[**2173-4-26**] CXR:
FINDINGS: A right pleural effusion is best seen on the lateral
projection and
is mild to moderate in size. A poorly defined opacity in the
right lower lobe
has progressed since [**2173-4-24**] and most likely represents an
evolving pneumonia,
linear densities in the medial right lower lobe likely represent
atelectasis.
Fluid seen in both major fissures is new since [**2173-3-23**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right, but small
in volume.
2. Evolving hazy opacity in the right lower lobe likely reflects
pneumonia.
.

FINDINGS: Liver appears normal in echotexture without focal
abnormality or
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Moderate-sized layering
right pleural
effusion. Trace perihepatic ascites. No fluid is seen in both
lower
quadrants or within the pelvis. The gallbladder is surgically
absent. The
proximal common duct is mildly dilated measuring 7 mm and is
nonspecific in
the setting of cholecystectomy. The visualized pancreatic neck
and proximal
body are unremarkable. The remainder of the pancreas is obscured
by overlying
bowel gas. Main portal vein is patent with antegrade flow.
Intrahepatic
portion of the IVC has normal ultrasound appearance. The
proximal aorta is
normal in caliber and the distal aorta is obscured.

The right kidney measures 9.6 cm and the left kidney measures
10.9 cm.
Preserved corticomedullary differentiation and cortical
thickening
bilaterally. Adrenal glands are not well visualized on
ultrasound.

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate layering right pleural effusion.

small bowel. There is no pneumatosis or free air. There is air
in the
rectosigmoid colon. Surgical clips project over pelvis. Small
bilateral
pleural effusions are noted. Right lower lobe hazy opacity
appears improved
from [**2173-4-26**] exam.

IMPRESSION:

Multiple dilated loops of bowel, compatible with obstruction .
No free air.
.
[**2173-4-29**] CT abd:
IMPRESSION:
1. No small bowel obstruction.
2. Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with the common
duct maximally
measuring 1.5 cm, unchanged since [**2169-7-23**].
3. Small-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
than left.
4. Effusions in combination with mild periportal edema, small
amount of
simple ascites and subcutaneous edema suggest increased volume
status.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 59 yo woman with PMHx significant for Addison's
disease on chronic steroids, COPD, chronic pain who presented to
OSH with fever, cough, n/v/d, and lethargy. Found to be
hypotensive and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
hypotension; concern for possible sepsis or adrenal crisis.
.
# Hypotension: Likely secondary to adrenal insufficiency and
mild hypovolemia in the setting of not taking steroids and
inadequate PO intake from nausea and vomiting. Patient was
started on stress dose steroids (100 mg of Hydrocortisone) and
received IV fluid boluses with subsequent improvement in her
blood pressures. On admission she received broad antibiotics out
of concern for sepsis; however, these were discontinued
secondary to low clinical suspicion for bacterial illness and
rapid improvement with hydration. Blood and urine cultures were
negative. Endocrine was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding steroid tapering and
recommended Hydrocortisone 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] through [**4-26**], then
decreasing to double her home dose for 3 days, then continuing
her on home dose. Her blood pressures remained stable prior to
transfer to the floor.  On the medical floor, her steroids were
tapered accordingly to Endocrine recommendations.  However, as
she developed a pneumonia (see below), she was discharged on 1
mg twice daily of Dexamethasone to be taken until her
antibiotics are completed (higher dose kept in setting of
current infection).  At that time, she is to decrease her dose
to 0.5 mg twice daily until follow-up with her primary
endocrinologist.
.
# Adrenal insufficiency: This episode of hypotension was likely
secondary to nausea/vomiting (secondary to viral illness) and
relative adrenal insufficiency due to inability to take po
steroids and concurrent stress.  She responded quickly to IV
fluids and stress-dose steroids.  Her steroids were slowly
weaned, however she was continued on a higher-dose (1 mg twice
daily of dexamethasone) due to her concurrent pneumonia.  She
was instructed to taper to 0.5 mg twice daily afte completion of
her antibiotics and to stay on this dose until follow-up with
her endocrinologist.  She recently had been hospitalized for
another episode of hypotension at [**Hospital3 **] prior to this
hospitalization; the etiology of this is not clear.  Her BPs
were stable during this hospitalization.
.
# Pneumonia, bacterial: Patient reported development of a cough
and slight shortness of breath during her hospitalization.
Initial CXR was negative for a PNA, however repeat CXR
demonstrated progression of a RLL infiltrate.  She was afebrile
and concern for resistant organisms was very low, so she was
started on Ciprofloxacin for a 7-day course.  She had small
bilateral pleural effusions on CXR; in discussion with
pulmonary, these were too small to be tapped.  She remained
afebrile, with improvement in her respiratory symptoms.  Her O2
sats were stable at 94-96%/RA.  She would benefit from a repeat
CXR next week to ensure no enlargement of the effusions.  These
effusions are likely secondary to her aggressive fluid
resuscitation on arrival.
.
# Abdominal distension without obstruction - The patient
complained of acute on chronic abd distension (for months, with
worsening over the past few days), without n/v.  She noted
excess flatus chronically and irregular bowel bovements.  Abd
u/s was negative for ascites (slight perihepatic fluid only,
likely secondary to her aggressive fluid resuscitation).  KUB
was read as obstruction, however upon review with the
radiologist, the KUB was only significant for dilated bowel.  A
subsequent CT abd revealed NO evidence of obstruction. She was
started on simethicone and miralax with improvement in her
symptoms.  She was tolerating a regular diet for several days
without any difficulty.
.
# Hyponatremia - stable during her hospitalization
.
# COPD: continued on outpatient regimen of combivent and advair.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: continued on outpatient regimen. She was
seen by SW during hospitalization as she does have many
stressors in her family life.  She would likely benefit from a
neuropsych evaluation, as there is concern that this may be
impacting her abilityto manage her medications and health on her
own.
.
# Chronic Pain: continued on outpatient regimen. Initially,
frequency of narcotics were reduced in setting of hypotension,
but were restarted at her home dose during her hospitalization.
She was recommended to taper these medications, as they can be
contributing to her constipation and hypotension, however she
notes that her pain is still at a constant and chronic level,
requiring her current dose of medications.
.
# GERD - continued on PPI

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and
fever.  You required several liters of fluid and high-dose
steroids to bring your blood pressure back to normal.  Your
steroid dose was slowly tapered to 1 mg twice of dexamethasone,
which you will continue through [**2173-5-3**].  On [**2173-5-4**], you should
decrease your dose to 0.5 mg twice daily and continue this dose
until your follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Your initial work-up did not show evidence of an infection, but
a repeat chest x-ray on [**4-26**] showed concern for a developing
pneumonia, so you were started on Ciprofloxacin for a 7-day
course.  This antibiotic is generally well-tolerated, but can
rarely cause rupture of the Achilles' tendon in the ankle. If
you develop pain in the ankle, please STOP this antibiotic
immediately.  The last dose will be on Monday, [**2173-5-3**].  Your
xray also showed some fluid in the lung spaces, but this was too
small to be drained.  You should have a follow-up xray next week
to ensure this is not getting bigger.
You also had abdominal distension, so an ultrasound was done,
which ruled out signficant fluid in the belly.  An xray showed a
lot of air in the bowel, so a CT scan was done to evaluate for
obstruction.  This was negative for obstruction and only
confirmed gas in the colon.
.
MEDICATION CHANGES:
1. START Dexamethasone 1 mg twice daily through Monday, [**2173-5-3**].
Change back to 0.5 mg dexamethasone twice daily on Tuesday,
[**2173-5-4**].  Continue this dose until you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**5-12**].
2. START Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily and continue through
Monday, [**2173-5-3**].
3. CONTINUE Miralax and simethicone as needed for constipation
and gas.

No other medication changes were made.

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 27yo F with history
of DM type 1, known grade 1 esophageal varices, status post
exploratory laparoscopy from trauma presenting with frequent
emesis with episode of coffee grounds and abdominal pain.
.
In the ER, initial vitals were 141, 133/96, 16, 99% 3L. Patient
was profusing vomiting and R femoral CVL was placed for access.
She had a very tender abdomen on exam and CT showed signs of
pneumobilia. Surgery was consulted who recommended admission to
medicine with serial abdominal exams. GI and liver were also
consulted. She was started on PPI and octreotide drips, and also
received dilaudid, zofran, insulin (home dose), zosyn,
metoclopramide and metoprolol. Her initial labs showed an anion
gap which later closed and small amount of ketones. Hct was
stable since prior on [**5-29**]. NG lavage cleared after 20 cc flush
and guaiac was negative. Vitals on transfer were 98.0 85 125/88
12 100% RA. FSBS 132.
.
In the MICU, patient is initially coughing/retching up clear
liquid. Soon after receiving IV dilaudid and reglan, she appears
comfortable and is fixing her hair. She reports being in her
usual state of health yesterday but awoke with a FSBS in the 60s
and has been vomiting throughout the day. The vomitus looked
like coffee grounds at one point so she came to the ER. Her
abdominal pain resolved in the ER but she continued to have n/v.
She has been unable to eat today.

Brief Hospital Course:
27F with T1DM c/b gastroparesis and anxiety who presented to the
ED with nausea, vomiting and one episode of coffee ground
emesis.

#Nausea/vomiting and coffee ground emesis - Had an EGD which
showed no source of active bleeding.  No note of esophageal
varices as previously reported on last EGD, some erosion of
gastroesophageal junction which was thought to be [**1-2**] retching.
Coffee ground emesis thought to be caused by [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear
from vomiting.  Received Zofran and Ativan for nausea with
improvement. Pt was continued on PPI 40mg daily on discharge.

#T1DM - While in MICU, Lantus dose was held on night of [**2132-6-13**]
because pt was not taking PO.  Was then given 8 units of lantus
during the afternoon of [**2132-6-14**] in the MICU.  She received an
additional 12 units of Lantus on the evening of [**2132-6-14**] to equal
her normal nightly dose of Lantus 20 units.  She was
additionally covered with Humalog per her home sliding scale.
She did not have any episodes of significant hyper- or
hypoglycemia despite the changes in her insulin regimen.  At
discharge, she will be continued on her home doses of Lantus 20
units at night and Humalog pre-meal and sliding scale after
meals.

#Anxiety/Tachycardia - Prior to transfer from MICU, she was
noted to be tachycardic to the 140s and hypertensive to the 160s
systolic.  When left alone, she calmed down and her HR and BP
returned to [**Location 213**].  The anxiety improved after transfer to the
floor, she was significantly less anxious at the time of
discharge.

#Electrolytes - Required repletion of potassium and phosphorus
on multiple occasions.  At discharge, both are back to normal
levels.

#Access - A peripheral line was unable to be placed and she
received a femoral line in the MICU.  This was removed prior to
discharge and hemostasis was ensured with 5 minutes of pressure
to the groin. No erythema or welling noted around the catheter
site.

#Transitional issues:
-Will need monitoring of glucose control after discharge given
disruption to her insulin dosing schedule
-Will need monitoring of electrolytes given low potassium and
phosphorus during admission

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted to the hospital with nausea and vomiting with
one episode of coffee ground appearing vomit.  You were in the
intensive care unit for one day and had an upper endoscopy which
did not show any active bleeding.  It is thought that the coffee
ground vomit was caused by your repeated vomitng.  Please
continue to take Zofran at home as needed for nausea.

For your diabetes, we continued you on insulin.  Your doses were
temporarily decreased while you weren't eating.  However, at
home you should continue to take your normal doses of insulin as
printed on your medication sheet. This includes Lantus 20 units
tonight as well as your normal pre-meal and sliding scale
humalog insulin.

Followup Instructions:
Please make a follow-up appointment with your primary care
physician for next week, we have contact[**Name (NI) **] your [**Name (NI) 6435**] office so
that you can be seen this week.

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Cath - POBA/DES to LAD

History of Present Illness:
41 yo M h/o hypercholesterolemia and two prior MIs, 1st at age
37, the second at age 40 presents with after a STEMI.  Patient
was out to dinner with friends for his birthday party.  Had one
drink plus one shot of alcohol, afterwards developed shortness
of breath and left arm numbness.  This was followed by [**9-26**]
crushing chest pain that radiated to the jaw, left arm, and
back.  Profusely diaphoretic at the time.  Called friend and was
taken to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **].

He had his first MI at age 37, after a [**11-20**] barbecue,
woke up in the middle of the night with left arm pain and chest
pain.  Was taken to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, then transferred to [**Hospital1 2177**]
where he had a catheterization.  He does not remember what was
stented.  His next MI was at age 40, where the patient says he
was awake for many hours and again developed left arm pain with
crushing chest pain.  This MI was treated at [**Hospital 3278**] medical
center.  Of note, the patient has not had insurance for 2 years
as he did not renew it because he ""felt ok.""  He had not taken
his medications for at least two years.  Those included lipitor,
aspirin, and nitroglycerin.  He does admit to having anginal
symptoms on exertion for the past few months.  When he walks
distances of a few blocks, runs, or lifts heavy things, he
develops a ""pinch"" in his chest as well as dyspnea.

In the ED, initial vitals were HR: 96 BP: 127/77 RR: 32 O2 Sat:
100 %. He was given Integrillin, morphine, ASA 81 x4, Plavix
(300 vs. 600?), heparin gtt and nitro gtt.  He vomited after
receiving the Plavix and aspirin, and received his aspirin dose
PR.  EKG showed ST elevations in V1-V4 with reciprocal
depressions in II, III, aVF, V5, V6.  Patient was taken
emergently to the cath lab.  On the way, developed V fib arrest
and was defibrillated once with return of sinus rhythm.  Patient
underwent cardiac cath which showed thrombotic total occlusion
at the prior LAD stent in the mid portion of the vessel. The Cx
had a total occlusion after a large OM1. The RCA had a total
occlusion in the mid vessel.  The clots were aspirated and a DES
was placed distal to his original stent in his LAD.

The patient arrived to the floor in stable condition.  He
currently denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting.  His vitals were Tc: 97 HR: 94 BP: 145/93 RR: 16 O2:
100% 2L NC.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, [**Hospital **] at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools.  He denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
42 y/o male with PMHx hyperlipidemia s/p 2 MI at age 37 and 40
who presents with STEMI.  s/p cardiac cath with POBA and
stenting of LAD with restoration of normal flow.

# STEMI - While being transported to the Cath lab, the patient
went into V fib arrest and became unresponsive.  He recieved a
200J biphasic shock from the defibrillator which converted him
back to a junctional rhythm and restoration of conciousness.  In
the cath lab, the patient had a Promus stent placed distal to
his first stent in his LAD after thrombus extraction and POBA.
He came to the CCU stable and chest pain free.  He was initially
started on prasugrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and
aspirin.  Due to his lack of insurance, the patient was switched
to clopidogrel from prasugrel and from atorvastatin to
simvastatin.  He had an echocardiogram which showed akinesis of
his anterior/septal/apical LV walls with an EF of 25%.  Because
of the risk of thrombus formation with his akinesis, he was
started on coumadin.  A heparin gtt was started to bridge him
over until he was therapeutic on coumadin.  He was instructed to
take his medications daily as his non-compliance was the reason
for his stent thrombosis.  He showed his understanding in the
importance of taking his medications every day, even if he feels
well.  He should also undergo plavix sensitivity testing as an
outpatient to see if he responds.  If not, then he should be
switched to prasugrel.
Pt does not qualify for Lifevest. Positive EP study wtih VT and
VF induced; ICD was placed and pt will have EP follow-up.

# Hyperlipidemia - The patient's lipid panel was obtained while
in house.  It showed an LDL of 152 as well as total cholesterol
of 232.  His goal should be an LDL < 70 as he is a high-risk
patient with history of STEMI. Initiated lipid control with
statin coverage - simvastatin 80mg and continue as an
outpatient.

# Hypertension - The patient was hypertensive while in the CCU
with SBPs in the 150s.  He was started on low-dose lisinopril
and metoprolol with normal blood pressures after. Continue these
meds as an outpatient.

# Lack of insurance - Social work was consulted to see if they
could help set the patient up with services, including health
insurance and a new PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to follow up with [**Hospital1 **] center/new pcp and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] as an outpatient cardiology.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] associates following for Mass Health/HSN application.
He will be given a free week supply of meds through Care Plus
Pharmacy. Advised pt to apply for unemployment benefits as
above, pt familiar with local unemployment office.

Dyslipidemia


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You had a heart attack and a dangerous heart rhythm called
ventricular fibrillation that needed to be shocked in to a
normal rhythm. The heart attack was because of a blocked stent,
this was opened again and another stent was placed in the left
anterior artery. You will need to take aspirin and Plavix every
day for one year. You risk another heart attack and death if you
do not take these medicines. Don't stop taking Aspirin and
Plavix unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] tells you to stop them. Your heart
function is very weak after this heart attack. We hope it will
improve over the next 4-8 weeks. In the meantime, you will need
to watch yourself closely for fluid overload which may cause
swelling in your arms or legs, a cough, trouble breathing or
inablility to lie flat at night. Please weigh yourself every
morning and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] if your weight increases more than 3
pounds in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
.
New medicines:
1. Start taking aspirin (325 mg) and Plavix daily to keep the
stents open and prevent another heart attack. You will take
Plavix twice a day for another 2 days, then decrease to once
daily after that on [**8-2**].
2. Start Coumadin to prevent blood clots and strokes from your
weak heart muscle. You will need to take this medicine every day
and get your blood checked frequently to prevent the blood level
from being too high or too low. Goal blood level is 2.0-3.0. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name8 (MD) 2716**], RN with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] will monitor your blood level and
tell you how much coumadin to take every day.
3. You will need to inject Lovenox twice daily until your
coumadin level is > 2.0. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 2716**] will tell you when it's Ok
to stop the Lovenox.
4. Start taking Simvastatin every day to lower your cholesterol
5. Start taking Metoprolol and Lisinopril to help your heart
pump better. These medicines will help prevent fluid buildup.
6. Start Cephalexin (Keflex), an antibiotic to prevent infection
at the pacer site.
7. Start Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen as needed for the pain at the
pacer site, this pain should get better every day.

chronic from [**2124**] MVC).  She describes the pain as sharp, [**7-9**]
in lower lumbar region, no radiation.  She took her usual meds,
including her insulin, but says she was not eating much due to
the pain.  Started having diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting
around 5 pm, emesis was bilious and non-bloody with no coffee
grounds.  Estimates that she vomited x3 at home.  States she was
walking down the street and the back pain got so bad she could
no walk anymore, so she called EMS.  In the ambulance, her
fingerstick was found to be >500.
.
She says she has had been taking her insulin as prescribed,
eating the same or less than normal.  Sugars have recently been
in the 200s at home.  Cannot identify any precipitating factors
leading up to today's [**Month/Year (2) **]. Says she is ""always chilled"" but
otherwise denies any recent fevers, abdominal pain (prior to
today), diarrhea, dysuria (though notes increased frequency),
cough, shortness of breath, or upper respiratory [**Month/Year (2) **].

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
27 yo hx of IDDM and recent admission for UGI bleed and
gastroparesis presents with increased back pain, abdominal pain,
n/v x1 day, found to be hyperglycemic with diabetic
ketoacidosis.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Diabetic ketoacidosis:  History and labs consistent with DKA.
Glucose >500 in ambulance and 686 in the ED, ketones in urine,
chem panel showed anion gap metabolic acidosis.  There was no
clear precipitating factor.  When she arrived to the unit there
was a delay in treatment because she lost both peripheral IVs.
We could not get new peripheral access and so a Right IJ line
had to be placed.  Of note, on her last admission, she also
needed a central line placed.  She was initially treated with an
insulin pump that was titrated according to ICU protocol.  She
was also given normal saline and her anion gap closed
appropriately.  When she appeared euvolemic, she was switched
over to D5,1/2NS, and when her gap closed she was started on sub
Q insulin.  She was initially started on her home dose lantus of
20 units in the am and then the regiment was transitioned to a
pm dose, which is when she takes it at home.  Her FSG became
stable. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and followed throughout the
hospital admission. Pt was scheduled with f/u at [**Last Name (un) **].
.
# Pneumothorax: [**Hospital **] hospital course was c/b large
right-sided pneumothorax. Approximately 1 day after transfer
from ICU to floor, patient developed tachycardia to the 140s.
Since patient was N/V and not tolerating POs, dehydration was
suspected and pt was given IV boluses. Tachycardia did not
resolve. A CXR revealed a large right sided pneumothorax.
Thoracics was consulted, who placed a pigtail catheter.
Subsequent CXRs showed resolution of the pneumothorax. Pt with
no known risk factors for pneumothorax; pneumothorax thought to
be secondary to R IJ central line placement.  However, developed
several days after R IJ was placed.
.
# Abdominal pain: Secondary to DKA vs. hyperglycemic
exacerbation of gastroparesis.  Abdominal exam was benign, but
effort was made to rule out intraabdominal process.  We intially
held her reglan and then restarted it later on.  We also sent
off a stool PCR for H. pylori since it was unclear whether she
had been treated appropriately in the past as well as C.diff. C.
diff studies were neg. Unsurprisingly, the H.pylori antibody was
postitive, as pt has had H. pylori in past but the PCR was
rejected and not run. As abdominal pain was decreasing, this was
deferred for further w/u to the outpatient setting. Patient was
scheduled with GI follow-up.
.
# Nausea and vomiting: Continued her Reglan and zofran.  Her
last gastric emptying study showed she was on upper limits of
normal.  She had continued voiting at the time of transfer to
the floor despites attempting to optimize her medications.
There was some concern that she was forcing emesis when
physicians were around because she seemed to tolerate food well
and not vomit when no one was paying attention and then start
vomiting when people entered the room.
.
# Depresssion: Psych and SW was consulted during admission, and
did not feel patient was a danger to herself. They saw no role
for inpatient psych admission, but suggested patient attend a
day program at [**Hospital 1680**] Hospital and an intake interview was
scheduled. Psych also recommended close psych f/u and pt start a
SSRI. Pt was started on Celexa 20 mg QD, which she tolerated
well.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Cr increased to 1.4 on admission from
baseline of 0.8-1.0, likely secondary to dehydration from DKA.
She had good urine output and her creatinine improved with fluid
rescusitation.
.
# Hyponatremia: Na 130 on admission, corrects to 136 when
accounting for hyperglycemia.  As she was fluid rescusitated
with normal saline, she became hypernatremic.  Her free water
deficit was calculated and she was treated appropriately with
IVF.  Her sodium returned to within normal range.
.
# Back pain: Exacerbation of chronic back pain [**1-2**] MVC in [**2124**],
no new trauma.  She was treated with dilaudid IV 1mg Q4H:PRN and
tylenol 1gm IV Q8H.  Her home regiment of gabapentin and
amytriptyline was continued.  She was transitioned to a PO
regiment once she was able to tolerate PO.  Her pain had

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] after
calling emergency medical services for increased back pain,
abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting. You were found to have
very high blood glucose levels and diabetic ketoacidosis, and
admitted to the intensive care unit for further management to
get your blood sugar decreased to a safe level. You saw a
diabetes specialist to help manage your diabetes.

You were also given medications for your back pain. Your
abdominal pain resolved with time. Nausea and vomiting was a
recurrent problem for you during this hospital admission, and
you received medications to help with these [**Hospital1 **]. When you
were able to eat again, you were discharged. You have been
referred to a gastrointestinal specialist for further work-up of
the causes underlying your abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.

You also saw a social worker and psychiatrist, who started you
on a new medication for your depression. She also recommended a
partial psychiatric program and close psychiatric care for
better management of your [**Hospital1 **] depression and anxiety.

On [**2132-8-2**], a chest x-ray showed that you had a right-sided
pneumothorax, which means that air had collected between your
right lung and the chest wall.  The thoracic surgery team put a
tube (called a pigtail catheter) in your chest to drain the air.
 Repeat chest x-rays showed that the pneumothorax had resolved.
On [**2132-8-3**], the pigtail catheter was removed.  A chest x-ray done
after removal of the tube looked stable.

MEDICATION CHANGES:
START Citalopram 20 mg PO QD-- you were started on this
medication to help with the treatment of your depression.
STOP Amitriptyline 10 mg once nightly-- you should STOP taking
this medication.
START ferrous sulfate (iron pill) 325 mg once per day.  The iron
pills may make your stools appear darker than usual.
START ascorbic acid (vitamin C) 100 mg once per day.  Take the
iron and vitamin C pills at the same time.
For pain, you may take over-the-counter tylenol as needed (do
not exceed 4 grams per day).  You may also take the prescribed
vicodin as needed for pain, but try to avoid taking the vicodin
if you can.

Your follow-up appointments are listed below. It is important to
attend all these appointments in order to feel your best.

It was a pleasure taking care of you. Please continue taking
your other home medications without any changes. Please don't
hesistate to contact the hospital or your primary doctor with
any concerning [**Date Range **].

Brief Hospital Course:
 38 yr old male h/o ETOH abuse and withdrawl seizures presenting
with ETOH withdrawal and abdominal pain.
.
# ETOH withdrawal: H/o polysubstance abuse and multiple previous
admits for detox/drug seeking behavior. Initially presented
intoxicated, agitated in the ED requiring multiple sedating
medications including valium (received 20mg IV, 10mg PO) however
on admission to the MICU he did not require further benzos. No
evidence of withdrawl objectively, evaluated by psych and not
felt to be in active withdrawl. Pt has h/o malingering and knows
how to manipulate CIWA scale.  Patient received banana bag, IVF
resuscitation while in ICU.  Since has been able to tolerate PO
and not required futher benzos while on floor.  Given MVI and
folate daily.
.
# Abdominal Pain: Unclear etiology, initial exam with epigastric
tenderness.  Had a CT demonstrating gastritis likely secondary
to ingestion of listerine, alcohol.  Also may have a component
of pain related to his ongoing chronic HBV/HCV and ETOH
ingestion, given his fatty liver demonstrated on CT and mild
transaminits on admission. These trended down during his
hospitalization.  He also had an elevated lipase, however he has
had similar levels on previous admissions so this appears to be
a chronic problem.  Additionally, abdominal pain is difficult to
interpret given patient's frequent complaints and refusal to
allow physical exam. He initially refused medications for
gastritis including PPI and GI cocktail.  He was also given
sucralfate but took this only intermittently.  On admission,
foley placement resulted in UOP of 500cc and there was initial
concern about urinary retention, however since foley d/c, pt has
been able to void on his own.
.
# Suicidal Ideation: Reported SI while intoxicated in the ED.
Seen and cleared by psychiatry. No SI at this time, no clear
plan.  No sitter required, does not meet criteria for section
12.
.
# Anemia: HCT near baseline. Likely anemia of chronic disease.
Normal MCV.  Hct stable throughout admission.
.
# FEN: Magnesium and potassium repleted in ICU.  Pt is
tolerating PO fluids.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and for
protection from alcohol withdrawl.  You had a CT scan that

gastritis.  Also there is some evidence of damage to your liver,
which is also refleted by some abnormalities in your labs.  This
is related to your heavy alcohol consumption.  You did not
experience alcohol withdrawal seizures during this
hospitalization and therefore did not need medications for that.
 It is important that you stop drinking because it is damaging
to your health and if you continue to drink heavily you will
die.

You were started on several new medications for your abdominal
pain and for your alcohol use.

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 96897**] is a 48 yo male with EtOH abuse and chronic HCV
infection, who presented to his PCP with complaints of
generalized weakness, lightheadedness and yellow eyes. Per her
note, he was in detox several days prior to presenting and he
states that he has not had a drink now in [**4-18**] days. He states
that his last episodes of drinking were not above average.
Denies any recent sexual contacts and denies any IVDU. Given his
clear jaundice on exam, his PCP sent him to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation. She was also concerned about encephalopathy.

He was admitted to the floor on [**2180-7-14**] with likely alcoholic
hepatitis. Liver service followed him there and was concerned

[**2180-7-14**] 12:20 AM # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96898**]   CHEST (PA & LAT)
Somewhat limited examination secondary to low lung volumes. No
definite superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.

No acute intracranial process.

[**2180-7-13**]   Radiology CT ABD W&W/O C
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogenous liver attenuation in addition to striking portal
adenopathy may indicate an acute hepatitis. Conversely, an
infiltrative liver malignancy cannot be excluded. This could be
further assessed with multi-phasic MRI.
2. Mildly distended gallbladder, wall edema, and pericholecystic
fluid.
Gallstones were visualized on previous ultrasound examination.
However, in the setting of no significant right upper quadrant
symptoms and no elevated white blood cell count, this seems
unlikely to be consistent wtih acute cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) ACUTE ON CHRONIC LIVER FAILURE: Most likely acute alcoholic
hepatitis given known history of alcohol abuse, AST/ALT > 2, and
negative hepatitis viral serologies (negative viral load in the
case of Hep C). His presentation was initially concerning for an
obstructive lesion given the new perihepatic LAD on abdominal
CT, but his AP was normal and a RUQ U/S showed no obstruction.
He had no additional risk factors for aquisition of other
hepatitis viruses (no recent unprotected sex or IVDU). His
presentation was also concerning for hepatic vein/IVC
thrombosis, but a liver U/S with doppler was negative for clot.
His autoimmune work-up ([**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibodies,
soluble liver antigen, ceruloplasm, urine copper for Wilson's
disease) was negative. His hepatitis serologies indicated
previous exposure but no active infection (HBsAg neg, HBsAb pos,
HBcAb pos, HBV DNA undetect, HCV RNA undetect, anti-HAV neg). On
discharge his bilirubin improved to 8.2, INR stable at 2.0,
platelets 92.

He had a liver MRI that showed no focal lesions, but fatty
infiltration, periportal LAD, and signs of portal HTN.  He was
started on prednisone 40mg PO daily and lactulose 30cc QID.

He continued to complain of vague RUQ pain, so an U/S was
repeated, with no changes noted. Furthermore, his LFTs have
trended down and stabilized; his AST remained only slightly
elevated at discharge, although his TBili was very high. He had
elevated INRs (max 2.6, decreased to 2.0) which were treated w/
PO vitamin K.

Outpatient liver clinic appointment scheduled to follow liver
disease and consider transplant.

2) ENCEPHALOPATHY: Patient was encephalopathic when admitted,
with an elevated ammonia level. He was treated with lactulose
30-45cc QID, but his dose was later decreased to 30cc TID due to
exacerbation of hemorrhoids and pain and blood with bowel
movements.  He was often reluctant to take his lactulose and had
to frequently be explained the reason for taking it.  He was
also treated with rifaximin.  Overall his mental status has
improved and he has been AAOx3, but with some residual
confusion.  Also, his gait is still slightly unsteady and he
continues to have asterixis on exam.  He is discharged on
lactulose and rifaximin, which he must take regularly.

3) ANEMIA: The patient had macrocytic anemia on admission
(Hct=27.7) and his hematocrit continued to slowly decrease
during his stay.  His B12 level was elevated and his folate
level was normal.  Iron studies showed normal Iron, decreased
TIBC, increased Ferritin.  Blood smear showed occasional
schistocytes and 2+ target cells.  He had a normal EGD and
colonoscopy, although the cecum was not visualized.  Given his
history and labs, he was thought to have anemia from chronic
liver disease and possible bone marrow suppression due to
alcohol use.  [**Month (only) 116**] have also been due to hemorrhoidal bleeding.
He was transfused with pRBCs to keep him above Hct=21, receiving
9 units over the course of his admission.  He had no s/sx of
transfusion reaction and his Hct was 25.3 at discharge.


4) FEVER: The patient spiked a fever to 101.9 on [**7-14**] and was
subsequently worked up for infection.  CXR was negative for
pneumonia x2, urine analysis and cultures were negative, and
blood cultures were negative.  Initial abdominal ultrasound was
negative for cholecystitis and showed trace ascites (<1cc),
although he did have ascites later on, and received two
ultrasound-guided paracenteses, negative for SBP.  His fevers
resolved and he had been afebrile from [**2180-7-19**] to [**7-29**], when he
started spiking fevers again. On [**8-3**], he spiked a fever up to
104.5 with hypotension to 80s and tachycardia to 110s. Pt was
started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc, levofloxacin,
[**Doctor Last Name **]), given copious IVFs and transfered to the MICU with SIRS
criteria. On admission to the MICU he was severely anemic to
Hb/HCT of 5.7/16.9. Pt was transfused 3U of pRBC and a 1L of NS.
His Hb/HCT elevated to 8.3/23.5 and stabilized. He was restated
on lactulose and antibiotics for GI PPX. All cultures were
negative. His BP and mental status improved. He was transfered
back to the floor in stable condition mentating at baseline with
stable VSS and afebrile.


5) HYPONATREMIA: Patient had low-normal serum sodium at
baseline, decreased to 131/132 at times during his stay. He
appeared euvolemic with no evidence of third-spacing of fluid on
exam.  Serum osmolality was 285 (within reference range).  It is
possile that these low-normal levels are secondary to cirrhosis
and intravascular volume depletion, leading to increased fluid
retention.  It could also be due to hypertriglyceridemia.
Adrenal insufficiency is also possible, but less likely given
his stable blood pressure. His sodium levels normalized prior to
discharge.

6) ALCOHOL ABUSE: Patient had no signs of alcohol withdrawal
during his hospital stay.  He was continued on thiamine, folate,
and multivitamin supplementation. Advised extensively to stop
drinking.

7) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Patient had a creatinine spike to 2.6
from his baseline of around 0.8. Renal consult felt this was
prerenal rather than HRS, so octreotide & midodrine were
stopped. His creatinine gradually improved to 1.3 and remained
stable.


8) SEIZURE HISTORY: Patient has an unclear history of seizures,
in setting of EtOH withdrawal vs. head trauma vs. childhood
issue. He was on phenytoin 100mg TID, but his drug level
increased to 22.7, so he was decreased to [**Hospital1 **] dosing, and a
repeat level was 20.7.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] with a diagnosis of acute on
chronic liver failure and encephalopathy (changes in your mental
status) due to the liver failure. You were kept in the hospital
to watch your liver function tests, which have improved. You
were started on lactulose and rifaximin, and must continue to
take it and have at least 3 bowel movements a day.

While in the hospital, you were found to be anemic.  Because
your red blood cells were low, we gave you transfusions to
increase your red blood cells.  You were also given IV fluids
and octreotide and midodrine, medicines to improve your kidney
function.  Your kidney function has not yet returned to baseline
but has improved.

During your hospital stay, you also had fevers and low blood
pressure.  Because of concern for infection, you were sent to
the ICU and your steroid treatments were stopped.  No infection
was found in your blood, urine, or the fluid in your abdomen.
You were transferred back to the medicine service once your
blood pressure normalized.  You were given IV vancomycin,
ciprofloxacin, and flagyl (antibiotics) for 7 days.

Please keep all follow up appointments and take all medications
as prescribed. We have lowered your dilantin to twice daily
based on your blood levels.

Please return to the hospital if you experience any of the
following symptoms:
- Temperature greater than 101.5
- fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, sweating
- Increased confusion or flapping of your hands
- Increase yellowing of your eyes or under your tongue
- Increased weight gain or fluid in the abdomen/legs
- Increasing abdominal pain

Extensive bullous change within lung apices captured in field
1. no fracture / malalignment
2. biapical bollous change

CT HEAD
Non contrast CT without edema, mass or hemorrahge.
Encephalomalacia stable on left temporal lobe as in MRI [**5-29**].
Ventricles and sulci normal, tiny left parietal scalp hematoma.

# no acute intracraneal process

ECG: ([**2-22**] 22:53)
Normal sinus rhythm at 83bpm, ther is baseline artifact and no
significant ST segment abnormalities.

CXR [**2163-2-23**]: Heart size is top normal, stable. Mediastinal
position is stable, unremarkable. Lungs are essentially clear.
Bilateral apical lucencies might be consistent with emphysema.
There are no areas of consolidation worrisome for infectious
process or aspiration.

CT scan thoracic/lumbar spine [**2163-2-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild convex left curvature of the thoracic spine, otherwise
normal CT study of the thoracic and lumbar spine. No abnormal
paravertebral soft tissue or fluid collection is seen. No
abnormality detected within the spinal canal on CT; however, if
there is concern for abnormality within the spinal canal, MRI
would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
2. Mildly sclerotic focus in the right iliac bone, along the
sacroiliac spine, of uncertain etiology but is
well-circumscribed, with non-aggressive features.
3. Bullous emphysematous changes of the upper lobes again noted.
Evidence of prior granulomatous disease in the lungs.
Additionally, with 7-mm spiculated nodule in the left lower lobe
of uncertain etiology. Given emphysematous changes, and size of
this lesion, initial followup CT would be recommended at three
months' time by [**Last Name (un) 8773**] society guidelines.
4. Small pelvic free fluid, incompletely visualized and of
indeterminate clinical significance.

Plain films of left foot [**2163-2-26**]:
FINDINGS: No comparisons available. The soft tissues of the
fifth left digit are swollen. There is a small axial deviation.
The most peripheral to the bony components appear irregularly
margined and slightly sclerotic at their borders. The picture
would be consistent with the degenerative rather than with the
destructive or chronic inflammatory change. There is no evidence
of cortical disruption that would suggest a traumatic origin of
the changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
41 year old man with past medical history significant for EtOH
abuse, c/b withdrawal seizures, with ? bipolar disorder,
presenting to ED by EMS after being found intoxicated on the
street, in fair condition.

# INTOXICATION: On admission, patient was minimally responsive,
with very high EtOH level ~3 hours after transfer to ED,
suggesting exceedingly high levels when found on the street.
Concern for ingestion of secondary substance, however serum osm
gap is exactly that predicted for this degree of EtOH ingestion.

Given history of seizure disorder, would also consider partial
complex seizure at this time, however given pts ability to move
all extremities and become verbally abusive and combative this
was felt to be much less likely.  Patient however was started on
CIWA with IV Diazepam shortly after ICU transfer due to severe
diaphoresis and tremulouness. OSH records obtained from last [**Hospital1 2025**]
ED admission 4 days PTA, and prior notes of similar breakthrough
seizures requiring loading with dilantin. Baseline levels of
dilantin were negative, patient was loaded with Phophenytoin and
continued on oral load. Patient was also given IV thiamine and
folate and transitioned over to oral agents and later to
multivitamin.
Patients withdrawal symptoms were appropiately treated and no
withdrawal seizures were observed. Ataxia was noted on physical
exam, and degeneration of cerbellar vermis was noted on prior
MRI imaging, likely alcohol-related. Patient was encouraged to
follow up with recommendations of social work to assist with
alcohol cessation, although was minimally receptive to these
suggestions.

# HYPOTHERMIA / LEUKOPENIA: At presentation thought likely due
to immobilization from EtOH stupor and exposure to cold. Body
temperature normalized with conservative therapy, however in
light of leukopenia pre-emptive infectious workup was pursued
including blood and urine cultures, chest x-ray, sputum cultures
and viral infection workup. WBC continued to trend downward
until ANC was less than ~500 and Patient developed fever after
warming up to 102. He was started on Cefepime / Vancomycin.
Given complaints of back pain, CT Thoracic and Lumbar spine were
obtained which revealed no concerning findings to explain
leukopenia. Blood cultures from admission revealed a single
bottle ([**1-23**]) with corynebacterium, felt to be a contaminant.
Fevers resolved and antibiotics were stopped. The leukopenia
improved slightly prior to discharge (ANC > 500) and was felt
most likely secondary to alcohol abuse.

# FACIAL LAC: Repaired in ED, Tetanus shot given. Unable to
assess for ligamentous neck trauma given profound intoxication
on admission. Patient maintained on [**Location (un) 2848**]-J collar until mental
status improver and there was full ROM and no point tenderness.
CT c-spine and head were negative for acute process. Lesion was
reasonably well-healed at time of discharge.

# SEIZURE DISORDER: As above, patient started on phenytoin given
history of recurrent withdrawal seizures.  He had several
episodes of questionable seizure during this admission
characterized by no LOC or incontinence (patient talked through
episodes) but questionable confusion (vs. uncooperative behavior
with answering orientation questions) and muscle jerks. These
movements may have been myoclonic jerks or possibly simple
partial seizure - patient received Ativan, although all events
were self-limited to less than one minute. After speaking with
members of the patient's primary care team, these events may
also have represented the ""pseudoseizures"" he has had in the
past. He was continued on phenytoin per neurology
recommendations and level was checked and found to be
therapeutic.

# Hepatitis B: Core antibody positive now. Was not checked in
[**2162**] (when surface Ab positive/antigen negative). Patient should
be followed for this finding.

# Spiculated lung lesion: 7-mm lesion was noted on CT scan
(incidental finding). Recommendation per radiology is for follow
up in 3 months by repeat CT scan. Patient was tested for PPD and
found to be positive. He initially reported to team that he had
never been positive in the past. Although the lesion was not
overly concerning for TB, he was placed on isolation precautions
and ruled out for active disease by three negative sputum
samples. Confirmation with his PCP later revealed that he has
been known positive for more than a decade and has already
undergone 4-drug treatment course in late [**2143**].

# Toe pain: The patient complained repeatedly of pain in his
toes. Toes were tender to palpation, with the most tender being
the left pinky toe. Out of concern for ? fracture or gout, plain
film imaging was undertaken of left foot. Other than soft tissue
swelling, no other findings were noted.
